0,1,0,75,224,"So let me just preface this by saying I started with the shows then read all of the asoiaf books and now I’ve finished the Tales, I’ve started learning the lore of the series and am in love with all of the magic. I’ve never really seen a “plot hole” (this isn’t much of a plot hole just something that seems implausible). I’m a huge fan of the series but one thing just doesn’t make sense in these short stories. 

In the first book, at the tourney of Ashford, Dunk has to go to a trial by 7 with 6 knights against Aerion and his knights. Dunk’s 6 are newly knighted Ser Raymun Fossoway, Ser Humfhrey Beesbury, Ser Humfrey Harding, Ser Lyonel Baratheon, Dunk himself, and Ser Robyn Rhysling (that’s 6). And he has to beg the crowd full of bystanders to have another champion.  Baelor “Breakspear” Targaryen (heir to the throne) ends up being his 7th champion. 

They fight and both of the Humfreys die, Dunk almost dies. They go back to the tent and the rest are checking on Dunk when Baelor asks to have someone help with his helmet because he’s feeling woozy. It turns out his head is caved in and the only thing keeping him alive was his helmet holding his brain in his head. So now 3 noble lords are dead one of them is the very beloved heir to the throne. All 7 of these people on his side are from different parts of Westeros and there are a bunch more lords in attendance all from all over Westeros. 

So my only confusion is, whenever he introduces himself as Ser Duncan the Tall, how does not everyone know who he is almost immediately? That story should be in everyone’s ears. Story tellers, singers, Dwarf troops, etc would all be showing this. Every Inn, Brothel, Pub, Wine Sink, etc would’ve spreading this story more than Bloody Flux did in Astapor. As much as people are complaining about Blackfyre related stuff, this should be the talk of the entire country. Some random hedge knight beat the shit out of a prince, twice. Had to fight a trial by 7 against Kingsguard and 3 Targaryen princes. Three of the Lord’s of fairly decent sized/wealthy houses die, one of them being the crown prince. How the *hell* doesn’t everyone just hear his name and bring up the tourney and trial? It’s the one thing I can’t believe. Some people do know who he is, I believe Maynard Plum tells him some people blame him for the troubles. But there shouldn’t be a time where people hear his name and don’t say something to him. That’s like not knowing who Ned Stark is and how he’s a “traitor” in the asoiaf series or the Joffrey was killed at his wedding. News spreads incredibly fast in Westeros and Ser Duncan the Tall and the tourney at Ashford should be in everyone’s recent memory. 

Great books other than this minor thing that I was thinking about, I think the relationship between Dunk and Egg is great. I can’t wait for Winds and the next Tale to come out. 
",1,[SPOILERS PUBLISHED] I Just finished the Tales of Dunk and Egg and there’s one thing I can’t seem to believe,2864,108
0,1,0,266,333," In ACOK when Daenerys learns about the death of Robert Baratheon and is told that Eddard Stark may have had a hand in killing him, Jorah Mormont immediately dismisses the idea of Ned forsaking his honor by saying -

&gt;*""Ned Stark a traitor?"" Ser Jorah snorted. ""Not bloody likely. The Long Summer will come again before that one would besmirch his precious honor.""*   

While Dany believes it for possible truth by saying – 

&gt;*""What honor could he have?"" Dany said. ""He was a traitor to his true king, as were these Lannisters.""*

It’s not surprising though for Daenerys to think this way about Eddard Stark considering how Viserys himself described him to Dany as *“cold-eyed Eddard Stark with his frozen heart”.* Only after Ser Barristan reveals to her the truth about her father in ASOS does Dany starts to see just how misinformed she has been all this time.

&gt;*The old knight did not blink. ""Your father is called 'the Mad King' in Westeros. Has no one ever told you?""*   
&gt;  
&gt;*""Viserys did."" The Mad King. ""The Usurper called him that, the Usurper and his dogs."" The Mad King. ""It was a lie.""*

We too fall victim to the false information we receive by unreliable narration, and take the false opinions of POV characters as facts instead of what they really are: false opinions.

I for one fell victim to Tyrion’s opinion on Mace Tyrell in *Tyrion III ASOS*

*Tyrell's* *reputation* *rested on one indecisive victory over Robert Baratheon at Ashford, in a battle largely won by Lord Tarly's van before the main host had even arrived.* ***The siege of Storm's End, where Mace Tyrell actually did hold the command, had dragged on a year to no result, and after the Trident was fought, the Lord of Highgarden had meekly dipped his banners to Eddard Stark.***

I take no credit for figuring this out, but someone pointed out to me that Mace Tyrell’s siege of Storm’s End was handled smartly. Had Robert's Rebellion failed and the Mad King kept his seat, Mace keeps his head on his shoulders. Had Robert won, the chances of him being pardoned with very little consequences increase because he neither harmed the castle walls nor spilled the blood of Roberts brothers - Stannis and Renly.

There are many instances where GRRM uses unreliable narration as misdirection to hide in plain sight the very subtle or obvious truth.

**What are some of those moments when you figured out that the truth is different then what the dialogue or inner monologue of the characters imply?**

**You could also mention moments where we (the reader/viewer) know the truth, but the characters don't.**",1,[Spoilers MAIN] Instances of Unreliable narration and false information,2600,71

2. **The Red Wedding**  
The Red Wedding is the most well known chapter in the entire book series. Everybody knows who died at the Wedding, but when you ask **who did it?** you get weird answers: The Freys, the Boltons, parts of the Karstarks, the Lannisters helped. But this isn't very narrowed down so here are the people who helped directly at the Red Wedding on the Frey side.   
Wives and children of the men bellow probably were at the Wedding, but because they hold little to no power or are kids I excused them.  


Red Wedders who payed for their sins:  
**Ryman Frey: Ryman played a key role in the Wedding. Apparently he is one of the main planners and he leads the attack in the diner room. He is seen killing Dacey Mormont.**  
Petyr ""Pimple"" Frey: Petyr started drinking with the Greatjon. He passed out drunk and slept through the entire Wedding  
Rhaegar Frey: Unknown how he was involved but he was a disgusting dick to Davos, Manderly and his granddaughter  
Jared Frey: Unknown how he was involved but he was telling lot's of lies to the Merman Court and tried to get Davos killed.  
Tytos Frey: Killed by Sandor Clegane at the Red Wedding  
Garse Goodbrook: Killed by the camps during the Red Wedding  
Aenys Frey: Participates in the Red Wedding  
Symond Frey: Treasurer and spymaster at the Twins, unknown but expected involvement  
Merrett Frey: Drank himself to sleep and missed the whole Red Wedding  
Benfrey Frey: Died of a wound received at the Red Wedding  


Red Wedders who are still unpunished:  
**Walder Frey: The patriach is obviously heavily involved in the Red Wedding**  
Edwyn Frey: The one who gets slapped by Caitlyn for wearing mail  
""Black"" Walder Frey: Kills a Vance at the Red Wedding  
Leslyn Haigh, Harys Haigh, Donnel Haigh: the Haighs are extremely loyal bannermen to the Freys, the Haighs all fight in the diner room where Leslyn loses an ear to the Greatjon.  
Hosteen Frey: Kills Lucas Blackwood  
Danwell Frey: Drinks with Marq Piper who is captured alive  
Raymund Frey: Kills Caitlyn  
**""Lame"" Lothar Frey: The main planner of the Red Wedding. Basically arranged it, gave people tasks and made Rains of Castamere the signal.**  
Jammos Frey: Involved but unknown how  
Whalen Frey: Tried to kill Grey Wind but Raynald Westerling caught his axe. Raynald Westerling then fell into the river and is never seen again.  
**Bastard Walder Rivers: Leads the attack on the camps**  
Lucias Vypren: Present but involvement unknown  
Damon Vypren: Present but involvement unknown  
Dafyn Vance: Possibly present because his daughter was presented to Robb Stark  


Possibly present but no noted involvement:  
Walton Frey  
Arwood Frey  
Ser Theo Frey  
Ronel Rivers  
Martyn Rivers: Best scout after Blackfish and supported Robb heavily  
Ryger Rivers: Really friendly towards Caitlyn

So these are the men who were involved in the wedding. If you should hate Freys hate these Freys, especially the marked ones. The rest of the people at the Red Wedding were: Kids, women and bannermen who operated under orders (what else could they do) So next time judge the people who should be judged.  


3. **Meet the Freys**  
This is what this post was mostly about. Giving the Freys some personality, they are not a united family that works towards the same goals. Many Freys hate each other and there are some big hints that their might be an upcoming Frey civil war. So I wrote this about the different Frey factions and who are the different individual Freys.So when you eventually read the Winds of Winter you will know who to root for and who to dislike.  


Walder Frey. Everybody knows Walder, he is a weasel like (and so are all his kin), heh laughing man who has had 8 wives who were all younger than him. He has an army from his trousers. I won't waste more words on him because everybody already knows Walder.  


Faction 0: The Royce Freys

The Royce Freys are not really a faction since their families are really splintered. They don't work well with each other and don't get along well.  
~~Stevron Frey~~: The only notable member that could be considered part of the Royce Freys would be Stevron Frey. Stevron was the heir to the twins for 65 years. He was raised to care for his entire family like Walder and was generally a good guy. He died in his sleep after a battle during the war of 5 kings.  


Faction 1: The Alfa Freys - the terrible family  
The Alfa Freys are decedents by Stevron Frey and his first wife Corenna Swann.  
~~Ryman Frey~~: Stevron might have been a good guy himself but he didn't raise his first son very well. Ryman is a drunk, a douchebag and one of the main architect of the Red Wedding. He also doesn't care for his family. When his youngest son Petyr is kidnapped he isn't even disturbed by it. Ryman also planned on kicking a lot of his relatives out of the Twins. Luckily he died by the hands of the Brotherhood without Banners.  
Edwyn Frey: Ryman oldest son is a bit better than his father. He is smarter and doesn't get drunk on the daily. Edwyn is described as hateful and lying though. Not many people have something good to say about him. He is the current heir to the Twins.  
Jaynce Hunter is Edwyn wife and they got one daughter named Walda Frey but everybody believes that Black Walder is the true father.  
""Black"" Walder Frey: Black Walder is a fighter, he leads the main Frey contingent they goes with Robb and he scales walls. He is also a generally arsehole to everybody around him. He has an extremely hostile relationship with the brother Edwyn, sleeps with lots of women in the Twins and insults a lot of people. ""He didn't get his name from his black beard"" describes him pretty well.  
~~Petyr ""Pimple"" Frey~~: Generally a sad character. He is extremely ugly, even without his face full with red pimples. He gets married when he was a kid to a woman three times his age Mylenda Caron. She rejects him and instead sleeps with his mean brother Black Walder. Their daughter Perra (named after her great grandmother) is probably a bastard.  
Petyr gets bullied and is generally a disappointment so he chills more with other Freys at the twins. He seems to be drinking buddies with Merrett and Danwell. He died when he went whoring and got captured by the Brotherhood without Banners. Who hang him for his ""participation"" in the Red Wedding.  


Faction 2: The Lydden Freys - the Vances  
The Lydden Freys are descendants by Stevron Frey and his second wife Jeyne Lydden.  
~~Aegon ""Jinglebells"" Frey~~: Jinglebells was the mentally incapable son that was eventually killed by Caitlyn Stark at the Red Wedding.  
~~Maegelle Frey~~: Maegelle grew up normally and was married to Dafyn Vance, we don't know which Vance branch they are from. Maegelle died in childbed.  
Dafyn Vance: Dafyn is the reason why this group of ""Freys"" aren't really Freys. The Vance Freys are really Frey Vances. We don't know their relationship with the other Vances but presumably the Frey Vances were present during the Red Wedding in which we see at least one Vance die by Black Walders hands. So maybe they aren't on the best terms. Dafyn also choose his wives family over his own so maybe his is either a lowranking Vance or he liked the Freys better.  
We don't know anything really about the plans that Dafyn Vances has even if he has any but if Edwyn and Black Walder die, his family is heir to the Twins since Walda and Perra are probably bastards.His three children with Maegelle are: Marianne Vance, Walder Vance and Patrek Vance.  


Faction 3: The Waynwood Freys - the one with the Vale ties  
The Waynwood Freys are descendants by Stevron Frey and his third wife Marsella Waynwood.  
Walton Frey: Walton is the one child by Marsella Waynwood. The Waynwoods are one of the most prestigious houses of the Vale. We known little about Walton, we don't know if he fought in any battles, we don't even know if he was present at the Red Wedding. His daughter was, so presumably. Walton seems to have had a good relationship with his now dead mother since Walton married into a bannerman family of the Waynwoods.  
Deana Hardyng: Deana is a member of house Hardyng. The same house as Harry the Heir from the Vale is from. Deana seems to have a good relationship with Walton. He doesn't ""use"" her as a breeding horse and Walton was probably on good terms with the Waynwoods and Hardyngs. They have two sons and one daughters  
Bryan Frey and Steffon ""the Sweet"" Frey: Two sons of Walton, nothing is known about them.  
""Fair"" Walda Frey: The most beautiful girl of all the Freys. Maybe Hardyng blood makes people pretty.  


Faction 4: The Lannister Freys - the ones that supported the other side  
The Lannister Freys are descendants by Emmon Frey and Genna Lannister  
Emmon Frey: He went to Casterly Rock at age 14 which made Tywin really angry. He feared Tywin his entire life. He is a sullen and scared guy. He almost never dares to raise his voice against anybody. Emmon is the ""rightful"" ruler of Riverrun but not of the Riverlands.  
Genna Lannister: Genna is the real leader of the Lannister Freys. During the War of the 5 Kings Genna followed her family into the war and Emmon just went with it. Their children had lived their entire life at Casterly Rock so it is not that surprising. Genna seems a friendly and happy woman who makes easy talk with everybody.  
~~Cleos Frey~~: The poor captured Frey that was forced to go between the Starks and Lannisters peace talks. His wagon got attacked multiple times and eventually he had to travel with Jaime and Brienne. When he dies he doesn't even get a proper burial. Jaime eventually tells everyone he died a hero so at least he got that.  
Jenye Darry: Jeyne is the wife of Cleos Frey. She is furious that her children didn't get Darry when the male line of Darry died. Instead Darry was awarded to her older sisters line.  
Tywin Frey and Willem Frey: the two sons of Cleos and Jeyne. Ty is currently the heir to Riverrun but Genna and Jeyne rather wanted Darry since the Tully's are still around.  
Lyonel Frey, ~~Tion Frey~~, ""Red"" Walder Frey: The remaining sons of Genna and Emmon. Lyonel is married to Melesa Crakehall, Tion is killed by Rickard Karstark and Red Walder is a page at Casterly Rock.  


Faction 5: The Wylde Freys - the wormy Bolton allies  
The Wylde Freys are descendants by Aenys Frey and Tyana Wylde.  
~~Aenys Frey~~: Aenys is considered one of the more scheming Freys, he is often called a worm. He commands the Frey force that goes with Roose Bolton. Aenys ""gets captured"" to get into Harrenhall but it is a ruse to capture the castle. Aenys is then one of Roose's advisers. After the War of the 5 Kings Aenys leads 2000 Frey men towards the North. There he stays at Winterfell until he is expelled and riding to fight Stannis but he trips and dies.  
Aegon ""Bloodborn"" Frey: Aenys' oldest son turned outlaw and is now named Aegon Bloodborn.   
~~Rheagar Frey~~: Rheagar is one of the three Freys sent to the Merman court. There Rheagar tells all kinds of lies about the Red Wedding. He is kind of a nasty douche and also associated with worms. He might be alive but was probably turned into a pie.  
The remaining Wylde Freys are Jeyne Beesbury and her three children Robert, ""White"" Walda and Jonos Frey. The Wylde Freys  right now consist of an outlaw and a mother and her children. Not the best position.  


Faction 6: The Haigh Freys - the loyal bannermen  
The Haighs are descendants by Perriane Frey and Leslyn Haigh.  
Perriane Frey: Married to Leslyn, they got three sons and a grandson.  
Leslyn Haigh: They are loyal bannermen, which is not surprising since they are also married into the family by Walder. This would be a great honor for the Haighs. Because of this Leslyn leads his sons and man to participate in the Red Wedding. He loses an ear to the Greatjon.  
Harys, Donnel, Alyn and Walder Haigh: They all were at the Red Wedding and Harys is seen wrestling with a Vance. They all survive. The Haighs go to Saltpans to invest the raid that happened there.  
The Haighs don't seems to have any special business except following the Freys.  


Faction 7: The Swann Freys - the unlucky ones  
The Swann Freys are the descendants by Walder Frey and Cyrenna Swann.  
~~Jared Frey~~: Married to Alys Frey who is from a minor branch. Jared is arrogant and looks like a weasel with a mustache. He is captured by Tywin but then ransomed at Harrenhall. He travels to White Harbor and tells that Robb did the Red Wedding. When Davos calls him a liar he threatens to kill him. Jared presumably ends up in a pie.  
~~Tytos Frey~~: Son of Cyrenna and Jared. Tytos is killed by Sandor Clegane at the Red Wedding with an axe in his head.  
Zhoe Blanetree, Zia Frey and Zachery Frey: the wife and children of Tytos. It is unknown where they are now.  
~~Garse Goodbrook~~: The Goodbrooks have no reason to like the Tully's, during Robert Rebellion they supported the crown and for that Hoster Tully burned their lands. Goodbrooks also didn't support Robb Stark fully and fought with the Lannisters during the siege of Riverrun under Daven Lannister. Garse Goodbrooks was killed by Sandor Clegane while fighting in the camps.  
Kyra Frey: The daughter of Jared and Cyrenna married to Garse Goodbrook. They good two children Walder and Jeyne.  
Luceon Frey: Luceon is interesting because he is a Septon. And not just a Septon he is the Septon that almost got voted to High Septon but the High Sparrow deposed him.  


Faction 8: The Crakehall Freys - the bully boars, oafs, hogs and pigs  
The Crakehall Freys are descendants by Walder Frey and Amarei Crakehall.  
Hosteen Frey: Ser Stupid. Hosteen is the best fighter of the Freys. He is strong and quick to angry. In short he is a typical Crakehall. All the Crakehall Freys are really similar to the main Crakehalls. Strongboar even takes a liking to the Crakehall Freys at Darry.  
Arwood Frey: We don't know much about Arwood, for example we don't know if he was at the Red Wedding. Arwood leads an investigation at Saltpans about who plundered the town. His mother is Bellena Hawick, the Hawick is the noble family from Saltpans. Arwood has four children with Ryella Royce Ryella, Alyn, Androw and Hostella Frey.  
Lucias Vypren: Lucias tracks a group of outlaws after the hanging of Merrett Frey. They might have something to do with it. Lucias is married to Lythene Frey, they got two children. Damon Vypren and Elyana Vypren who is married to Jon Wylde and they got one kid, Rickard Wylde.  
~~Symond Frey~~: Symond is the spymaster at the Twins. He is not really shown to be a terrible person but he uses his wives handmaidens as spies in White Harbor and he tries to bribe multiple guards and servants. He leaves for Winterfell but is never seen again (Frey pie). He is married to Betharios of Braavos, they got three children. Alesander, Alyx and Bradamar.  
Alesander, Alyx and Bradamar Frey: Alyx is described as one of the more beautiful maidens presented to Robb. Alesander is one of the Frey who was not allowed to be at the Red Wedding. This worries Caitlyn helped her understand something was wrong.  
Danwell Frey: He is married to Wynafrei Whent. They can't seem to get any children but they got a lot of miscarriages and stillbirths (Whents being cursed?) Danwell is also a bit of a disappointment to his dad. He fails and riding and isn't as strong as the other Crakehall Freys, the only time he doesn't fuck up is during the Red Wedding where he was supposed to make Marq Piper drunk and capture him. In which Danwell succeeds. He currently lives with the Crakehall Freys at Darry.  
~~Merrett Frey~~: Merret Frey is the best known Frey because he was a POV character. He cares for his siblings and their offspring. He dislikes/hates the Alfa Freys and even though he talked often about personal stuff he mistrusts Lame Lothar. He thinks that he needs to earn his family a place at the Twins or find another place. Merrett and his family try this in different ways: They all start living at Darry because Merrett's wife is Mariya Darry so they claim it, Hosteen tries secure the North and get the Dreadfort through ""Fat"" Walda's offspring and Merrett tries to gain favour with the Alfa Freys by paying for Petyr Pimple's life. He get hanged by Lady Stoneheart on flimsy evidence. Jaime describes him as stupid and a bully but strong.  
""Gatehouse"" Ami Frey: The slut of the family. She slept with everybody and now through her mother she rules the Darry lands. Ami also has lots of other Freys around her, especially many Crakehall Freys. Strongboar tries to win favour with her by promising her the killers of her father. Her mother Mariya Darry and her sister Marissa Frey are also with her.  
""Fat"" Walda Frey: Another daughter of Merrett, she is currently the Lady of the North and pregnant. Not certain how long that will last.  
~~""Little"" Walder Frey~~:  Like father like son. He bullies Big Walder, the Reeds, Bran Stark and later participates in torturing Theon/Reek. In the end the little shit is murdered by someone unknown but suspects include: Ramsay, Manderly and Lady Dustin.  
~~Geremy Frey~~: Drowned while drunk driving.  
Carolei Waynwood, Sandor Frey and Cynthea Frey are at the Waynwoods in the Vale.  
Raymund Frey: The last Crakehall Frey is Raymund. Almost nothing is known about him and his offspring. He is only seen twice. Once at the beginning of the Red Wedding and a second time when he slits Caitlyn's throat.   
Raymund is married to Beony Beesbury and they got seven children including two twinpairs. Robert, Malwyn, Serra, Sarra, Cersei, Tywin and Jaime Frey. Judging by the cute nicknames their children get they are well liked.  
The Crakehall Freys don't have the best relation with the other Freys and they generally seem stupid, slow and like boars/hogs/pigs.

&amp;#x200B;

Faction 9: The Blackwood Freys - the schemers  
The Blackwood Freys are descendants of Walder Frey and Alyssa Blackwood.  
""Lame"" Lothar Frey: The steward of the Freys. Lothar was apparently the one that planned most of the Red Wedding. Including the signal Rains of Castamere. Lothar is dangerous according to Merrett Frey. Merrett talked often with Lothar, Lothar said that the Alfa Freys hated each other and all the other Freys. He was convinced that the Alfa Freys would throw anybody out of the Twins unless they were useful. This is the reason so many Freys agreed to help at the Red Wedding or keep their mouths shut. They would otherwise lose their home. Lothar is probably scheming to make himself lord of the Twins.  
Leonalla Lefford: Lothars wife and they got four daughters called Tysane, Walda, Emberlei and Leana.  
Jammos Frey: Lothars brother married to Sallei Paege and they got three sons ""Big"" Walder, Dickon and Mathis. Big Walder is convinced that he will be Lord of the Crossing. If Lothar usurps the Twins Jammos would be his heir and after that Big Walder. So he might not be entirely wrong.  
Whalen Frey: Lothars other brother married to Sylwa Paege. He drinks himself to sleep trying to make the Greatjon drunk. He has a son and a daughter Hoster and Merianne. Hoster is a squire at the Paege lands.  
Moyra Frey: Moyra is married to Flement Brax. They got three sons Robert, Walder and Jon Brax. Flement Brax is one of the more important commanders at the Lannister camp. He also rides with Jaime to finish the Siege of Riverrun.  
Tyta ""the maid"" Frey: She is apparently a 30 year old maiden.  
Both Lothar Frey and Big Walder seems very smart and scheming. The Blackwood Freys are also tied into the Paeges who were noted to be absent during the siege of Riverrun.  


Faction 9: The Rosby Freys - the loved Freys  
The Rosby Freys are descendants of Walder Frey and Bethany Rosby.  
Perwyn Frey: Part of Robbs personal bodyguard. Excluded from the Red Wedding. Described by Daven as a decent man.  
~~Benfrey Frey~~: Married to Jyanna Frey. They have two children called ""Deaf"" Della and Osmund. Benfrey gave away Roslin during the Red Wedding. His face got smashed by Dacey Mormont with glass when he tried to grab her arm. He later died of infection.  
Maester Willamen: A maester at Longbow Hall of house Hunter, a mayor house in the Vale.  
Olyvar Frey: Robbs loyal squire that didn't want to leave him even after he betrayed their house.  
Roslin Frey: The girl that married Edmure. She seems to love him very much and fears for his life. Both Edmure and Roslin seem to be some of the sweetest characters.  
Because of their Rosby ancestry the Rosby Freys are also more beautiful than the others.

&amp;#x200B;

Faction 10: the Farring Freys - the bastards  
Arwyn, Wendel, Colmar, Waltyr, Elmar, Shirei are all still children and are suspected of that they are not Walders brood but Black Walders children.  


Remaining:  
Bastard Walder Rivers: A great fighter and good commander. He leads the Freys often into battle. Described as a cunt with a black heart. Has a son, a daughter and a granddaughter. Walda, Aemon and Walda.  
Maester Melwys: A maester at castle Rosby, a rich house in the crownlands.  
Jeyne Rivers and Mellara Rivers: No noted importance  
Martyn Rivers: One of the best scouts after the Blackfish. He seems to have been friends with Perwyn Frey.  
Ryger Rivers: A courteous guy towards Caitlyn.  
Ronel Rivers: Captured at Harrenhall and later ransomed.

Ser Theo Frey: The Frey that came out of nowhere and was suddenly cool enough to go to tourneys with the main Freys.  


  
4. **Statistics**

&amp;#x200B;

  
5. **What to take away from this?**  


Whew, that was long. I knew the Frey family was big but this is just absurd. People think the Freys will die out. I don't think you can kill them anymore, they breed as fast as rabbits. But back to the point, this should be a learning experience.  
I wrote this for myself more than anything but maybe there are some other crazy people like me out there that care for big families. I wonder if anybody took the time to read through to the end.

What to take away from this? This is a help tool when you read the Winds of Winter. You can easily look up this post and  check what Freys you want dead and what Freys are kinda bros. So you won't be cheering when Lady Stoneheart kills innocents, children, guys who weren't there and people who were working towards making the world a better place.  
Use this post so you won't be surprised when Lothar usurps the Twins or Bastard Walder wins an epic battle or Edwyn and Black Walder kill each other. 

This post is also my research before I try to predict what will happen within the Riverlands during Winds of Winter. I haven't figured everything out: Will Jaime and Brienne escape, will the Brotherhood keep supporting Lady Stoneheart, will she take revenge during Davens wedding, where is the Blackfish, will the Crannogmen do anything, what happened to the Tully garrison, will the Vale invade and what sides will the Freys fight on. Basically I have not yet figured anything out.

I also wanted to highlight the fact that plenty of Freys do good things. Arwood and the Haigh go to help Saltpans when they get raided, Lucias Vypren searches for outlaws, Martyn and Ryger are really courteous, Hosteen seems to love his brother and his kids, Alesander, Perwyn and Olyvar who supported Robb so much they weren't allowed at the wedding, Roslin who prays for a girl so Edmure won't be killed, shoutout again to Edmure for being one of the few lords who protects his smallfolk, Ami who lets her disgraced family stay with her before they are probably kicked out of the Twins, Merrett who goes to rescue his brother from another mother, Danwell who is a fuckup but stays loyal through the bullying, Raymund who seems to have a loving wife and family, Septon Luceon who is really popular and almost got voted High Septon, Fair Walda, White Walda, Little bee and other wholesome names, Genna and her children who all seem great guys, Cleos who was maybe a bit dumb but not a bad guy, Walton who by all accounts doesn't seem like a bad dude and Petyr who through all the bullying kept with his family. The Frey rule over the Riverlands also doesn't look all that bad, they don't harass the populace.  
Maybe they aren't the best and maybe the bad things are more plentiful. The Freys also have hearts.

&amp;#x200B;

The final point is: George RR Martin always write grey characters. The Lannisters seem all bad but when you get into their heads and explore their side only Cersei and Tywin seem worse. The Freys are the same, why would GRRM write a family with 200 members and then make them all ugly weasels that like to kill people. With 200 members you will get some terrible apples and some sweet ones. Right now I would argue that a lot of the bad apples have died already.

0,1,0,4,4,"We know the Long Night was a planet wife event not confined to Westeros, with the struggle against the Others ranging from the Wall to the Five Forts. Despite this a lot of the fandom seems to assume that the various heroic figures (particularly the Last Hero of First Man myth and Azor Ahai of Rhlorric faith) are the same person. Whilst I firmly support the idea that Azor Ahai, Huggo Amai of Sarnath, Hukko of Pentos, Hugor of the Hill, and Hyrkoon the Hero are the same myth in different forms I don't think that all heroes said to have ended the Long Night are the same. The Rhoynar claim a giant turtle ended the Night and the Yi-Ti that the Lion of Night and Maiden of Light did it. The reason the various Azor variants work is because they are clearly etymologically and thematically linked, with a focus the sacrifice of women, blood magic and a sacred sword. By contrast the Last Hero myth is about a man seeking the children of the forest, losing his dog, horse and companions then at last riding out to fight for the Dawn founding the Night Watch, and The Prince That was Promised seems to have even less to do with Azor Ahai, simply saying that a saviour would come from the Blood of the Dragon. Do people feel that these legends are the same legend or are they simply several different cultures rationalising the end of the Long Night - to use a real world example Noah's Ark and the Greek Myth of Deucalion are both flood myths probably talking about the same flood but no one says that Deucalion IS Noah. I'm not saying Azor Ahai isn't important but it's a little odd that a westerosi myth managed to spread to the other side of the world in what was basically a prehistoric civilisation.

On March 27, 2017, close to 2 years ago, I posted what was supposed to be Part 1 of 3 in a series about the whereabouts of Tyrek Lannister: [Littlefinger's Third Knight pt. 1 — Arya's Dead Guy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6206je/spoilers_extended_littlefingers_third_knight/) (Also on my blogspot, [here](https://asongoficeandtootles.wordpress.com/2017/03/28/littlefingers-third-knight-part-one-aryas-dead-pool-dude/).)

On April 5, 2017, I posted the follow-up: [Littlefinger's Third Knight, Ser Byron, is… Tyrek Lannister?](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/63masy/spoilers_extended_littlefingers_third_knight_ser/) (Also on my blogspot, [here](https://asongoficeandtootles.wordpress.com/2018/12/15/littlefingers-third-knight-ser-byron-is-tyrek-lannister-a-k-a-where-is-tyrek-part-2/).)

Writing Part 3 took me down a bajillion side wormhole posts I wanted to have finished before I posted Part 3. Then I decided to just finish *everything* I wanted to write before posting again.

And now it's about to be 2019 and very, very soon I will *finally* be posting Part 3. In the intervening time, the readership of the sub has obviously experienced a ton of turnover, and many people active prolly don't know anything about these theories, so I thought I would share the links to them, since it's vital to understand the thesis of Part 2, especially, if Part 3 is going to make any sense.

**TL;DR of [PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6206je/spoilers_extended_littlefingers_third_knight/):** Contrary to a somewhat popular belief, Arya's Dead Man By The Pool in the House of Black &amp; White is not the long-lost Tyrek Lannister (one of Robert's two squires who was forced into a marriage to an infant, dubbed ""Wet Nurse"" by the other squires, and who disappeared during the riot in King's Landing in ACOK), as many think, but one Alesander Frey.

**TL;DR of [PART 2](https://asongoficeandtootles.wordpress.com/2018/12/15/littlefingers-third-knight-ser-byron-is-tyrek-lannister-a-k-a-where-is-tyrek-part-2/):**  There's a rather shocking amount of evidence that Tyrek Lannister is currently in Vale in the guise of Ser Byron the Beautiful. Like: it's makes a *ton* of sense, thematically, phenotypically, etc. And yet I conclude by stating:
&gt;Having come this far, and (I hope) presented the powerful case that Ser Byron is Tyrek Lannister, I have a confession: I don't think he is. But I do think we'll be openly led to believe he is, and that we must be convinced that it truly seems like Byron is Tyrek—a Loras-bodied, Joffrey-looking Sansa-mirror, the perfect true knight to enchant ""Alayne"" into going rogue and fleeing the vale—to understand what's really going on.

Give the full reads a look if you like. GRRM's doing some really fascinating stuff here, IMO.

Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I thought it was pretty cut and dry that Tyrion was coerced by Tywin to participate in Tysha's rape, in turn becoming a rape survivor himself. However, I heard recently people stating clearly that Tyrion was a willing participant, primarily based off his retelling to Shae in *A Clash of Kings, Tyrion X ""* …and I should have defied him, but my cock betrayed me, and I did as I was bid.""

&amp;#x200B;

Their reasoning being:

1. There's no indication he couldn't have just walked away from the situation
2. Having an erection means he was aroused by the gang rape and therefore willing
3. Tywin and Tyrion are alike, so if Tywin was okay with it Tyrion must have been as well.

Are you really telling me that a disabled thirteen year old being commanded by the third most powerful man in the kingdom, who happens to be his father, had the wherewithal and ability to say no and walk away?

&amp;#x200B;

Are you actually stating that a 13 year old getting an erection indicates that he's willing to participate in a gang rape, even though it's described as a betrayal i.e. going against what the child actually wants to do?

&amp;#x200B;

How do you even go about explaining your last point with a straight face?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to name and shame, but really, am I in the minority here?Just in case, here's a bit more information on what can define rape ""The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent.""  


EDIT: On looking back at the conversation the third point their intent might have been more like ""Tyrion became more like Tywin due to what happened which is exactly what Tywin wanted"" but it's a little clunky. Here's a transcript:  


1 “…In Tyrion’s later recollection, it wasn’t him being forced to participate in Tysha’s rape, it was that his cock betrayed him. Now, I guess it’s important to note in that kind of second telling that Tyrion is indicating that he has a choice in the matter. How much of it was actually a choice and how much of it is his guilt causing him to think that it’s a choice when it really wasn’t is… I don’t know, I guess it’s at least mentioning as a potential consideration, but you really can’t excuse Tyrion’s role necessarily. He was a willing participant in Tysha’s rape. There’s no indication from Tyrion’s point of view in this chapter or when he tells Shae in *A Clash of Kings* that he couldn’t have just walked away and said ‘No, I won’t take part in this’. He basically said that he had sexual desire for Tysha and that he participated in her rape.”  
2 “One of the takeaways from this is that what Tywin was trying to do to Tyrion worked at some level, because Tyrion does think about Tysha this way – “   
1 “Yeah”   
2 “– and kinda clearly did in the moment if he was still willing to have sex with her even after watching this horror inflicted upon her. Like, the mental transition had been made. Tyrion thinks of her that way and has dehumanised her that way, just as Tywin wanted, and Tywin is Tyrion’s abuser but Tyrion has become Tywin in a lot of ways - ”   
1 “Yes”   
2 “- in terms of his mindset, in terms of his actions. And so you have a position where Tyrion is certainly a victim of Tywin but also complicit in the abuse of Tysha, and so that’s where he gets his aunt Genna saying that Tyrion is Tywin’s son, not you, to Jaime. And Tyrion saying the latter’s final moments that I’m you writ small.“   
1 “Mmm hmm”   
2 “That’s what makes this kinda thing I think as powerful as it is on a tragic element, that is as much as Tyrion and Tywin would like to distance themselves from each other, they are at some level the same person.”  
1 “It makes it even worse when you think about Tyrion’s arc in *A Dance with Dragons* and how dark it gets, in that the reveal that Tysha was not a sex worker, the reveal that it wasn’t that Jaime had paid for her services, that leads to Tyrion becoming ever more like Tywin Lannister, whether it’s raping a sex worker in Selhorys, whether it’s thinking ‘If I was in charge of the battle at The Battle of Fire I would have poisoned all the wells’, it’s just so brutal that the reveal that Tysha’s backstory was exactly what Tyrion had originally suspected to be, but then gone on believing that for some thirteen or fourteen years believing the story that Jaime and Tywin had told him, that that then leads to Tyrion becoming so much more Tywin just makes it ever more hearbreaking, what happens to him in *A Dance with Dragons*, and what will continue in *The Winds of Winter*.” ",1,(Spoilers Main) Tyrion's complicity with Tysha,4780,46

So, as of now I'm still lacking on some details that I've missed, but I've read all the books so far, and I'm planning on reading them all over again too (It's frustrating when I see everyone on this sub talking about and mentioning details that completely flew over my head 😂). But more importantly, I wanted to stress the brilliance and genius of the author himself , Martin, and the work he put into something this incredible. I've written fantasy and science fiction at certain points in my life as well, so to see the vast amount effort that's been put into world building and lore is insane. Other than the main plot, ever since I'd finished ADWD, there were just so many things left unexplained. I wanna see Asshai and Sothoryos!!!! Those giant, tattooed walking lizards with claws that were mentioned have to be dinosaurs for sure!!! And I'm sure the book version of the origin of the white walkers will be much more interesting than the one from the HBO series! 

I discovered these books at a low point in which I was experiencing some mental issues and breakdowns, and this universe was the perfect escape for me. ASOIF managed to keep my mind in check somehow. The writing is just so well done and assuring, seriously, this man has such a way with words that I wouldn't have ever thought would be possible. We don't exactly know how long it'll take Martin to finish the books, but I'm so looking forward to seeing how everything plays out. Will Dany ever go to Westeros? What's the deal with that Aegon kid? What will be the outcome of the battle of Slavers Bay? 🤔 I seriously can't wait any longer.

TLDR: I discovered ASOIF during a huge pit of depression earlier this year and it pulled me through.

0,1,0,8,2,"I notice the Scandinavian raiders of the Viking age are constantly compared to the Ironborn in the series. This opinion is so entrenched that I've come across someone who ""dislikes Vikings because they dislike the Ironborn and the Ironborn are based on the Vikings"" (possibly slightly paraphrased). 

However, it seems to me as though the Northmen resemble the Norse and Danes at least as much as the Ironborn do, if not more. They're both polytheistic; they believe in the Old Gods and are set apart from the rest of the realm who believes in the Faith which is most similar to Christianity. They both perform sacrifices for their religion. They're generally both thought of as savage. They're literally both called Northmen since they're from the north and they are both used to colder weather and substandard land quality. Because of this, they don't partake in the frivolous stuff the southron counterparts and are generally more martial (in the books, they don't have tourneys, they have actual brawls where it's expected that a decent amount of people die, rather than southern tourneys where a death is out of the ordinary). 

On the other hand, they're compared to the Ironborn because they both raid in boats. However, I don't see where the comparison continues anywhere else. The Vikings didn't believe in this weird Iron price thing; trading and farming weren't looked down upon at all in Scandinavian society. The religion of the Ironborn is a dualistic religion more akin to Zoroastrianism and even the religion of R'hllor, just with less fire and more water. 

I'm sure more similarities can be drawn between both sets of Northmen, but I wanted to post this and read some other people's opinions before continuing.

[Here](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/asoiaf/new-pov-i-spoilers-for-affc-t734.html) is the report for the draft of Cersei II read in Sep 2001 Worldcon. One thing not mentioned in the report is the mysterious Gardener coins Qyburn discovered in the cell of Rugen (which as we know was one of the disguises of Varys). If it was mentioned in the early draft, surely the people who took such detailed notes would have noted it and discussed what it might mean. In the published story, Gardener coins serve as just another tool that furthers Cersei’s paranoia about the Tyrells. It is obvious that Varys planted them in order to sabotage the Lannister/Tyrell alliance. 

* The discarding of the 5 year gap resulted in dramatic changes to the original plans. At the beginning, Cersei was meant to rule for 5 years. Once the gap was gone, the Lannister/Tyrell alliance had to fail much sooner than anticipated. GRRM invented several tools to make this process work faster in his mind. One of them was the introduction of Maggy’s prophecy to greatly fast-forward Cersei’s descent into madness. As this early draft implies, another later addition for breaking up the Lannister/Tyrell alliance effectively seems like the decision to leave Varys behind so that he could actively sabotage it.

* The interesting question is this: if Varys was not supposed to plant these coins in the early draft, what was he supposed to do and where was he supposed to be? I argued in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9ygd21/spoilers_extended_quaithe_and_the_meereenese_knot/) that Varys was originally going to Meereen in the 5-year-gap scenario and he was the perfumed seneschal Quaithe warned Dany about. Since the 5-year-gap was discarded and Varys stayed behind, GRRM had to create another perfumed seneschal coming to Meereen (or else he would have dropped it from Quaithe’s warning). And I think the new perfumed seneschal is Marwyn. Either he or Quaithe is bad news for Dany. Probably both.

0,1,0,40,122,"Earlier I posted a [well-received theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/7yy61a/spoilers_extended_unnoticed_point_about_the_pink/) that magic in ASOIAF has a few simple rules rooted in sacrifice to certain elemental forces:  In short: You are what eats you.  If you give your blood or a kinsman's blood to an element, your blood is somewhat amended by it and you become resistant to its effects.  Craster sacrifices his sons to the cold; the Others pass him by.  Gared has lost his ears to frostbite and a brother to hypothermia; the Others let him flee.  The Ironborn sacrifice to the sea and are unstoppable there.  Melisandre, who sacrifices to fire, is able to walk unburned in the hottest places in Dragonstone.  I think of this as the Pantheon (""all the gods"") theory.

The seats of the great houses include features that would facilitate sacrifice to an element that is characteristic of that house.  The Arryns have a Moon Door, and their dungeon is the Sky Cells, where prisoners are encouraged to leap to their deaths.  The Tullys have the water stair – direct river access within the castle walls.  The Starks have an iron cage where prisoners can be exposed to the cold.  And Casterly Rock has oubliettes as tight, Jaime says, as a suit of armor, where the Lannisters of old sacrificed high nobles and even kings.

A few other examples have come to mind.  First, a cunningly hidden example of an in-world character who seems to know the rules of magic:

# Randyll Tarly

When Sam fails to be the heir his father wanted despite a courage spell, Randyll makes Sam choose between taking the black and being murdered.  But it's *how* he would be murdered that's interesting:

&gt;“If you do not, then **on the morrow we shall have a hunt, and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble, and you will be thrown from the saddle to die** . . . or so I will tell your mother. She has a woman's heart and finds it in her to cherish even you, and I have no wish to cause her pain. Please do not imagine that it will truly be that easy, should you think to defy me. **Nothing would please me more than to hunt you down like the pig you are**.” His arms were red to the elbow as he laid the skinning knife aside. “So.  There is your choice.  The Night's Watch”—he reached inside the deer, ripped out its heart, and held it in his fist, red and dripping—“or this.”

This shows GRRM's genius:  A hunting accident is a timeworn way to disguise a murder.  And we are primed to interpret Randyll's threat that way because it is how Cersei kills Robert.  But the cliche hides a second meaning:  The Tarlys’ god is *the hunt*, like their sigil, and Randyll is proposing to sacrifice his heir by hunting him.  (The Greeks and Romans had goddesses of the hunt, Artemis and Diana.)

# Belwas

Belwas proclaims himself greater than Khrazz, supposedly the greatest champion in the history of the fighting pits.  How has Belwas survived so long?  He sacrifices himself a bit in each combat.  He says so twice.  First when he is introduced:

&gt;“I am Belwas. Strong Belwas they name me in the fighting pits of Meereen. Never did I lose.” He slapped his belly, covered with scars. “**I let each man cut me once, before I kill him.** Count the cuts and you will know how many Strong Belwas has slain.”

And again after the fight before the walls of Meereen:

&gt;“It is nothing. I let each man cut me once, before I kill him.” He slapped his bloody belly.

Who is Belwas sacrificing himself to?  His opponents, or to combat generally?  It’s not clear.  But his custom is too strange, amid the other evidence of blood sacrifice, to be coincidence.

# The Unsullied

It is fitting that Daenerys acquires an army of Unsullied, because the Unsullied too have sacrificed to fire – and not a small sacrifice:

&gt;""The goddess is called by many names. She is the Lady of Spears, the Bride of Battle, the Mother of Hosts, but **her true name belongs only to these poor ones who have burned their manhoods upon her altar**.""

The Unsullied wash with sand, not water and, consistent with the idea that sacrifice to an element confers some immunity to it, the Unsullied bear up well even in the heat of Meereen.

# The Night’s Watch

In the earlier post I raised the idea that the Night’s Watch is the Seven Kingdoms' sacrifice to the cold, and the Wall is the instrument for that sacrifice.  If the wards alone would keep the Others out, why bother with the ice?  To ensure that it is “always cold at the Wall”.  Consistent with that idea, the dungeon at Castle Black is the ice cells.  And if sacrificing onesself to an element amends the blood with it, the men of the Night's Watch *do* become brothers in a sense as they stay longer at the Wall and give more of themselves to the cold.

The notion that the Wall is an instrument of cold sacrifice is supported by Fire and Blood:

&gt;The men of the Night’s Watch were as thunderstruck by the queen’s dragon as the people of White Harbor had been, though the queen herself noted that Silverwing “does not like this Wall.” Though it was summer and the Wall was weeping, *the chill of the ice could still be felt whenever the wind blew, and* ***every gust would make the dragon hiss and snap***. “Thrice I flew Silverwing high above Castle Black, and thrice I tried to take her north beyond the Wall,” Alysanne wrote to Jaehaerys, “but every time she veered back south again and refused to go. Never before has she refused to take me where I wished to go.”

As [others](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9r9mi3/spoilers_extended_what_is_the_reason_for_this_old/) have pointed out, between ASOS and ADWD Bran seems to amend his memory of Old Nan's reassurances that the Others cannot pass south ""so long as the Wall stands *and the men of the Night's Watch stay true*\[.\]""  As I argued in Part I, joining the Night's Watch is a way of sacrificing your whole remaining life to the cold.  But only if you keep the vows!  And Jacquen tells us early that there are consequences for stealing sacrifices from the gods:

&gt;""The Red God has his due, sweet girl, and only death may pay for life. This girl took three that were his. This girl must give three in their places. Speak the names, and a man will do the rest.""

Except as a reason to help Arya escape Harrenhal, this notion of sacrifice owed to a god is a shoe that has yet to drop.  I think it will come to the fore at least two ways.  First, if the Seven Kingdoms owe a sacrifice to the cold, Jon Snow has committed grave breaches.  Not only has he foresworn his vow and announced his intent to leave the Wall – withdrawing the sacrifice of his own life – but he has helped steal Monster from the Others.  If the Wildlings themselves were part of the Pact – either as hostages for humanity, or as a free-range sacrifice north of the Wall – letting them pass south might have been a further breach.

Regardless, Jon deserved his death because he broke his vow to be part of Westeros’s sacrifice to the cold.  That view of the Night's Watch oath fits Bran's vision:

&gt;He saw the Wall shining like blue crystal, and his bastard brother Jon **sleeping alone in a cold bed, his skin growing pale and hard as the memory of all warmth fled from him.**

At least since ADWD, the conventional view has been that this passage is Bran’s premonition of a dead Jon.  But it could be a glimpse of Jon's purpose as a man of the Watch:  Jon is cold because it is always cold at the Wall.  He is sleeping alone because he has sworn to take no wives and father no children.  And the memory of all warmth is fleeing from him because the cold is gradually claiming his life.  In fact, the cold got that life in the end:

&gt;He never felt the fourth knife. ***Only the cold*** ...

In this light, look again at the Horn of Joramun.  If the Wall is an altar to the cold gods, the Horn is not just a doomsday weapon, but a horn to blow in triumph when that sacrifice can be renounced.

# Dorne

Many readers (myself included) were annoyed to see so many Dornish characters introduced so late.  But remember that we will need the Dornish god, the sun:

&gt;The salty Dornishmen were lithe and dark, with smooth olive skin and long black hair streaming in the wind. The sandy Dornishmen were even darker, **their faces burned brown by the hot Dornish sun**. They wound long bright scarfs around their helms to ward off sunstroke. The stony Dornishmen were biggest and fairest, sons of the Andals and the First Men, brown-haired or blond, with **faces that freckled or burned in the sun instead of browning**.

Sun imagery surrounds Prince Oberyn, whose battle dress shows he views the sun as an ally.  Tyrion notes that Oberyn has removed the visor from his helm.  No need to shield his eyes (at least from the sun, heh.)  And Oberyn is on defense throughout his battle with Ser Gregor – until the sun comes out:

&gt;The Mountain snorted contemptuously, and came on . . . and **in that moment, the sun broke through the low clouds** that had hidden the sky since dawn.  
&gt;  
&gt;***The sun of Dorne***, Tyrion told himself, but it was Gregor Clegane who moved first to put the sun at his back.  
&gt;  
&gt;*This is a dim and brutal man, but he has a warrior’s instincts.* The Red Viper crouched, squinting, and sent his spear darting forward again. Ser Gregor hacked at it, but the thrust had only been a feint. Off balance, he stumbled forward a step.  
&gt;  
&gt;Prince Oberyn tilted his dinted metal shield. **A shaft of sunlight blazed blindingly off polished gold and copper, into the narrow slit of his foe’s helm. Clegane lifted his own shield against the glare.** Prince Oberyn’s spear flashed like lightning and found the gap in the heavy plate, the joint under the arm.

Of course, the “sun of Dorne” is the sun everywhere.  But if the Dornish are allied with the sun as the Targaryens are allied with fire and the Ironborn are allied with the sea, the new Dornish characters look like a necessary part of the alliance against the two hazards of the Long Night: the cold *and the dark*.  That future alliance might have been why Aegon I spared the Dornish in the first place.

# The Ironborn

I don’t have any particularized ideas for the Ironborn, except that their sudden prominence in AFFC might be explained by their alliance with the sea, just as the Dornish are explained by their alliance with the sun.  The Ironborn have continued to practice blood sacrifice to the sea.  And one of our POV characters, Aeron, is a priest of that religion.

# Further implications and possibilities

*Bloodraven*.  Giving yourself gradually to an element to become one with it is precisely what the COTF claim Bloodraven has done and what he urges Bran to do:  The tree roots have grown into him and absorbed his flesh and blood, and Bloodraven has become part of the tree.

*Reek.*  I noted in Part I that flaying is a way of sacrificing to the air.  House Bolton's most ardent flayer is known for keeping company with (and being unaffected by) Reek I and II, known for the bad air that accompanies them.  Ramsay even hid his identity by smearing himself with excrement and adopting the reeky mantle for himself.  The symmetry seems significant.

*Aerea*.  In Fire &amp; Blood, we read the fate of young Aerea, who &gt;!leapt onto Balerion’s back and flew with him, Septon Barth suspects, to Valyria.  When she returned, her body was scalding to the touch, and firewyrms writhed within her skin.  Both girl and wyrms died when they were doused in icewater!&lt;.

I think Aerea is another example of the principle that in ASOIAF you are what eats you.  &gt;!If a firewyrm is full of dragonfire even when it is very small, contracting firewyrms would be a way to sacrifice oneself to dragonfire slowly enough to become quite dragonlike by the times the wyrms matured!&lt;.

*Harrenhal.*  Seemingly all the seats of the great houses include some feature that would facilitate sacrifice to a particular element.  Although Harrenhal was built long after those castles, I think it's no exception:  Harren was going to sacrifice to the Gods Eye, a sacred lake:

&gt;Its colossal curtain walls rose beside the lake, sheer and sudden as mountain cliffs\[.\]

We know the Isle of Faces in the Gods Eye is central to the Pact.  By proposing to become king of the Gods Eye, Harren might have crossed a red line in the bargain struck to end the Long Night.

*Our willing sacrifices*.  Using the logic that sacrifice to an element wins its allegiance for you and your kin, House Martell might be in an unusually good position vis a vis dragons or the Targaryens/Blackfyres.  Although Quentyn the Dragontamer was tragically unwilling to burn himself with the candle before he left to tame dragons, he arguably sacrificed himself to dragonfire when he arrived.

Did he die by dragonfire?  I think so.  But one could argue that Quentyn might have joined the characters who seem immune to elemental forces they willingly confront.  For example:

* Tyrion survives drowning after he tackles the stone man, though without a nose he couldn't hope to keep out the waters of the Rhoyne.
* Theon survives a long jump off the walls of Winterfell.
* Daenerys herself survives a walk into Drogo’s funeral pyre.

We see Quentyn notice his clothes are on fire, then start screaming.  He doesn't perceive any pain, but pain can lag injury in the real world.  Then again, Daenerys’s clothes burned in the pyre even when she didn't, and she didn’t perceive any pain either.  Assuming that this kind of all-in self-sacrifice is survivable, the difficulty might be that Quentyn was not burned by the dragon he chose to tame; he was burned by the one he forgot about.

In any event, perhaps a new footnote in the “Quentyn Lives” debate.  And even if Quentyn died, his death might have positioned the remaining Martells to enjoy a special affinity from Dany’s dragons, Dany herself, or fAegon.

**tl;dr:  There are suggestions of a coherent theory of magic in ASOIAF based on winning the allegiance of certain elemental forces through blood sacrifice. That theory may be a useful lens for predicting future developments.**",1,(Spoilers Extended) Pantheon Theory Part II: More evidence for the Pantheon,14177,75

####YE OLDE TEASER:
Here's Dontos and Sansa in the Red Keep's Godswood:
&gt;**""Who's there?"" she cried. ""Who is it?"" The godswood was dim and dark, and the bells were ringing** Joff into his grave.

&gt;**""Me.""** He staggered out from under the trees, reeling drunk. **He caught her arm** to steady himself. **""Sweet Jonquil, I've come. Your Florian has come, don't be afraid.""** (SOS S V)

Here's Ramsay's wedding in the Godswood:
&gt;**""Who comes?""** [Ramsay's] lips were moist, his neck red above his collar. **""Who comes before the god?""**

&gt;Theon answered. ""Arya of House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown and flowered, trueborn and noble, she comes to beg the blessings of the gods. **Who comes to claim her?**""

&gt;**""Me,"" said Ramsay. ""Ramsay of House Bolton, Lord of the Hornwood, heir to the Dreadfort.** I claim her."" (DWD PoW)

#Sansa and Sandor's REAL (But Still Figurative) Wedding

A few years back, /u/cantuse [crafted a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1uv7gr/spoilers_all_sansa_the_pretty_little_maegi/) arguing persuasively that when Sansa tries to hide her bloody menstruel sheets by burning them in her fireplace in ACOK, she in effect uses fire-and-blood-fueled bloodmagic—definitely figuratively, maybe even literally—to summon herself a hero to save her from her marriage to Joffrey, and is ""given"" Sandor, *whom she symbolically marries, thus passing into his protection, when she imagines kissing him and when she huddles under the stained Kingsguard cloak he leaves in her room:*
&gt;**She found his cloak on the floor, twisted up tight**, the white wool stained by blood and fire.… A chill wind was blowing, banging the shutters. Sansa was cold. **She shook out the torn cloak and huddled beneath it on the floor, shivering.** (COK San VII)

More recently, /u/7th_Cuil revived this theory as part of [a larger post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/5vtu75/spoilers_main_sandor_clegane_the_antiknight_and/) on Sandor.

It's my belief that there is actually strong evidence that Sansa doesn't ""really"" figuratively marry Sandor when she first ""huddled beneath"" his cloak, but that instead she transforms Sandor's abandoned Kingsguard cloak into a facsimile of Sandor's *personal* cloak, which she later dons as a figurative bride's cloak during a different figurative marriage ceremony than the one posited by cantuse and 7th: *a proper northern wedding in a godswood, before a heart tree.*

(Note that this has nothing to do with whether Sansa and Sandor will end up ""in love"" or *literally* married or anything of the sort. It's straight textual analysis or some pretty blatant symbolism.)

***

##White Ain't Sandor's Color
First thing's first: A knight of the Kingsguard can't marry, so a white Kingsguard cloak being a symbolic wedding cloak feels a bit off.

Moreover, Sandor doesn't just forget his Kingsguard cloak. Nor does he give it to Sansa. Instead he discards it, abandoning it as he does the Kingsguard. The white cloak Sansa shivers in isn't *truly* Sandor's cloak anymore, literally or figuratively, nor does it represent Sandor as an individual. At least not *literarily*, to us. *Not while it remains a white Kingsguard cloak, anyway*. (That said, it certainly may represent Sandor to Sansa, and thus the scene works as an expression of her subconscious, inchoate desire for him.)

There is, of course, a mundane sense in which the cloak is nevertheless still ""Sandor's"". Certainly the text refers to it accordingly as ""his cloak"", so the *idea* of Sansa wearing ""Sandor's"" cloak as in a Westerosi wedding is certainly immanent here, even if it's only being gestured at. But it's my belief that this idea isn't anchored in strong symbolism until the aftermath of the Purple Wedding, when Sansa and Sandor get figuratively married for real (so to speak).

##The Hound's Green Cloaks (and plain brown roughspun clothes)

While a White Cloak hardly embodies Sandor, he does show a strong personal preference when it comes to his fabric choices. Here's Sandor early in AGOT at Ned's Tourney—that is, at an event in which men expressly dress themselves in their personalized, identifiable colors:
&gt;Sandor Clegane was the first rider to appear. He wore **an olive-green cloak** over his soot-grey armor. (GOT E VII)

He wears a green cloak (over soot-grey armor).

Here's Sandor late in AGOT:
&gt;""You will attend me in court this afternoon,"" Joffrey said. ""See that you bathe and dress as befits my betrothed."" Sandor Clegane stood at his shoulder in **a plain brown doublet and *green mantle*,** his burned face hideous in the morning light. Behind them were **two knights of the Kingsguard in long white satin cloaks.** (GOT S VI)

Again, a green cloak (i.e. ""mantle""—see below), this time implicitly contrasted with the Kingsguards' white cloaks, thus showcasing Sandor's chosen cloak color.

Make no mistake: a ""mantle"" is a cloak.
&gt;A mantle (from mantellum, the Latin term for **a cloak**) is a type of loose garment usually worn over indoor clothing to serve the same purpose as an overcoat. Technically, the term describes **a long, loose cape-like cloak** worn from the 12th to the 16th century by both sexes, although by the 19th century, it was used to describe any loose-fitting, shaped outer garment similar to a cape. (wikipedia)

Notice, too, that Sandor's clothing here is otherwise *""a plain brown doublet""*. Even after he's a Kingsguard, Sandor wears *""his brown roughspun tunic""* under his white cloak. (COK S I) I know it's only cloaks that are changed at a literal wedding, but as you'll see in a minute, some people don't stop there when the wedding is symbolic.

To clarify: I'm not arguing that in-world Sandor necessarily wears these/this green cloak(s) to declare his identity that same way a Lannister might so wear a red and gold cloak. I'm only saying that as a practical matter of fact, *Sandor's personal cloaks are green* (and that he seems to favor simple brown wool garments under the cloak, when he's not wearing his ""soot-grey armor""). He *may* view green cloaks as his own hallmark, but whether he does or not isn't important to the present hypothesis, which is about a *symbolic/figurative* wedding (cloak).

Much later, when Sandor is traveling to Riverrun with Arya, he is in disguise, and what do we see? His coloration symbolically reflects that he is in hiding, *reversing itself* like Oberyn's daughter Sarella disguising herself as ""Alleras"" the Sphinx in AFFC. Now his body, which was garbed in soot-grey armor at the tourney, is garbed in green like his old cloak and mantle, while his green cloak and mantle are replaced by a cloak the color of his soot-grey tourney armor:
&gt;…the Hound himself was garbed in **splotchy green roughspun and a soot-grey mantle with a hood that swallowed his head.** (SOS A X)

Notice that he still favors simple roughspun. Note, too, that Sandor's disguise ""mantle"" has a *huge* hood. Did the cloaks he wore earlier have hoods as well?

One might ask, ""What happened to the green cloak/mantle he wore before?"" It will be my argument that it was figuratively passed to Sansa, who dons ""it"" in a symbolic wedding ceremony in the Red Keep's godswood. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Finally, as Sandor is ""dying"", a green cloak manages to find him again:
&gt;When the time came to leave, [Sandor] needed Arya's help to get back up on Stranger. He had tied a strip of cloth about his neck and another around his thigh, and taken the squire's cloak off its peg by the door. **The cloak was green**, with a green arrow on a white bend, but when **the Hound wadded it up** and pressed it to his ear it soon turned red. (SOS A XIII)

The Hound wadding up this green cloak and getting it bloody naturally recalls the unintentional ""bloodmagic"" ritual by which Sansa at least figuratively ""summoned"" Sandor:
&gt;Snatching up her knife, Sansa hacked at the sheet, cutting out the [blood]stain . . . She pulled the torn sheet from the bed, and the stained blanket as well. I'll have to burn them. **She balled up the evidence**, stuffed it in the fireplace, drenched it in oil from her bedside lamp, and lit it afire. (COK S IV)

##Weddings and the Boles of (Ancient) Oak Heart Trees
Sandor is also associated with the color green when he ""is"" a green leaf during Arya's ""prayers"" in the Harrenhal godswood:
&gt;The queen and Ser Ilyn and Ser Meryn and **the Hound were only leaves**, but [Arya] killed them all as well, slashing them to wet **green** ribbons. (COK A IX)

Arya's ""prayers"" ultimately focus on Joffrey—Sansa's betrothed at the time—and ""the bole of an oak"":
&gt;**[Arya] slashed at birch leaves** till the splintery point of the broken broomstick was **green** and sticky. ""Ser Gregor,"" she breathed. ""Dunsen, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling."" … ""The Tickler,"" she called out one time, **""the Hound,""** the next. ""Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei."" **The bole of an oak loomed before her**, and she lunged to drive her point through it, grunting ""Joffrey, Joffrey, Joffrey."" (A X)

Arya's attack on an oak bole representing Sansa's betrothed is curious in light of several links between oak boles in godswoods, weddings and Sansa.

Consider Sansa first meeting with Dontos in the Red Keep's godswood:
&gt;Ser Dontos placed a hand **on the gnarled bole of the heart tree.** He was shaking, she saw. **""I vow, with your father's gods as witness**, that I shall send you home."" (COK S II)

Dontos is swearing ""on the gnarled bole"" of the Red Keep's ""heart tree"", which we know is also an oak:
&gt;**The [Red Keep's] heart tree there was a great oak, its ancient limbs** overgrown with smokeberry vines… (GOT E V)

By taking an oath (""I vow…"") on the bole of the ""ancient"" heart tree, Dontos reminds us of the northern custom of saying ones *wedding* vows before a heart tree, and thus of weddings in general.

Both trees are described using the term ""bole"". Bole is just a fancy way of saying tree trunk, but *that's the point.* It's *notable* verbiage, and I'm convinced GRRM uses specific verbiage to tag and connect things in his story. While the word ""bole"" doesn't make many other appearances in ASOIAF, most of them point in the direction of ""Northern Weddings"". First, there's a Northern clan named Bole:
&gt;The army covered twenty-two miles the first day, by the reckoning of the guides Lady Sybelle [Glover] had given them, trackers and hunters sworn to Deepwood with clan names like Forrester and Woods, Branch and **Bole**. (DWD tKP)

Second, there's a weirwood described in the same terms (""gnarled and ancient"") used to describe the Red Keep's heart tree:
&gt;From one such island rose **a weirwood gnarled and ancient, its bole** and branches white as the surrounding snows. (DWD tS)

Third and most important, it just so happens that *during ""Arya's"" wedding to Ramsay*, Theon thinks of ""hiding his treasures in *the bole of an ancient oak*"" in Winterfell's Godswood. The idea of hidden treasure makes us think of women's sexuality: Shae is Tyrion's ""secret treasure""; the Watch calls the whores of Moletown ""buried treasure"". Note that Theon's oak and its reference to women's sexuality is described using the same ""ancient"" adjective used to describe the oak heart tree in the Red Keep (and Winterfell's heart tree in AGOT C I). Thus the ancient ""bole-tagged"" oak heart tree on which Dontos says his vow to Sansa at the Red Keep prefigures the ancient ""bole-tagged"", treasure-guarding oak of Winterfell we see when ""Arya"", Sansa's sister, says her wedding vows before Winterfell's ancient heart tree.

Why describe these trees so similarly? Perhaps because the real wedding of the fake Arya echoes the fake/figurative wedding of the real Arya's sister before the Red Keep's Theon's-oak-esque heart tree (or perhaps its textual equivalent, as will be discussed).

##Sansa's ""Marriage"" to Tyrion
Consider what Sansa wears to her actual wedding to Tyrion:
&gt;[T]he **gown** itself was **ivory samite and cloth-of-silver, and lined with silvery satin.** The points of the **long dagged sleeves almost touched the ground** when she lowered her arms. And it was a woman's gown, not a little girl's, there was no doubt of that. The bodice was slashed in front almost to her belly, the deep vee covered over with a panel of ornate Myrish lace in **dove-grey.**… They brought her new shoes as well, **slippers of soft grey doeskin** that hugged her feet like lovers. (SOS San III)

Stark colors, plainly. Meanwhile, her maiden's cloak (i.e. the cloak in the maiden's colors that gets replaced by the bride's cloak, in the groom's colors) is characterized by being ""heavy with pearls"":
&gt;""The cloak,"" [Cersei] commanded, and the women brought it out: a long cloak of white velvet **heavy with pearls.** A fierce direwolf was embroidered upon it in silver thread. Sansa looked at it with sudden dread. ""Your father's colors,"" said Cersei, as they fastened it about her neck with a slender silver chain.

&gt;A maiden's cloak. (ibid.)

Bank that. It's important.

Now, what happens to Sansa after her *actual* wedding to Tyrion, when she's removing her clothing *and thus preparing for the consummation of her wedding?*
&gt;""And my clothing?""

&gt;""That too."" He waved his wine cup at her. ""My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage.""

&gt;**Her hands trembled as she began fumbling at her clothes. She had ten thumbs instead of fingers, and all of them were broken. Yet somehow she managed the laces and buttons,** and her cloak and gown and girdle and undersilk slid to the floor, until finally she was stepping out of her smallclothes.… (SOS San III)

Her hands quake and fumble as she disrobes. Bank that too.

##Sansa's Purple Wedding Garb
The clothing Sansa wears to the Purple Wedding, just before her escape via the godswood with Dontos, sounds curiously similar to what she wore to her wedding to Tyrion:
&gt;Sansa wore a **gown of silvery satin trimmed in vair, with dagged sleeves that almost touched the floor**… (SOS Ty VIII)

That ""gown"" sounds a helluva lot like her wedding ""gown"". It's almost blatantly symbolic of it:

- ""lined with silvery satin"" : ""silvery satin""
- ""long dagged sleeves almost touched the ground"" : ""dagged sleeves that almost touched the floor""
- ""soft grey doeskin"" : ""vair"" (i.e. greyish-blue squirrel fur/skin)

##Sansa's ""Marriage"" To Sandor
Summarizing a few key facts:

- Sandor's favors green mantles/cloaks (worn with ""soot-grey"" armor)

- Sandor pairs his cloak with ""a plain brown doublet"", and later a ""brown roughspun tunic"".
- In disguise, Sandor later wears ""green roughspun"" with a soot-grey mantle, reversing his colors. In a sense, his green mantle is ""missing"", as is his brown roughspun tunic.
- Sandor is given a ""green"" cloak; he ""wadded it up"" and got it bloody, much as Sansa wadded up the sheets stained with her menstrual blood and burned them, a la bloodmagic.
- Arya's ""prayers"" associates the Hound with green.
- They also associate Sansa's bethrothed with the bole of an oak in a godswood.
- Dontos swears a vow on the bole of the Red Keep's ""ancient"" oak heart tree.
- ""Boles"" are associated with the north, and with a weirwood described like the Red Keep's heart tree.
- Theon hides his treasures in the bole of an ""ancient"" oak in Winterfell's godswood.
- Theon remembers this during the wedding of a woman posing as Sansa's sister, which takes placed before Winterfell's (also ""ancient"") heart tree.
- Sansa's fingers fumbled with her clothing after she was married to Tyrion.
- Sansa wears an outfit to the Purple Wedding that reminds us of her wedding outfit.

Now, here's what Sansa does in the Godswood after the Purple Wedding. Remember, at a Westerosi wedding ceremony the bride removes a cloak of her father's colors and dons a cloak of her husband's colors.
&gt;She found her clothes **where she had hidden them**, the night before last. With no maids to help her, **it took her longer than it should have to undo the laces of her gown. Her hands were strangely clumsy**, though she was not as frightened as she ought to have been. ""**The gods** are cruel to take him so young and handsome, at his own wedding feast,"" Lady Tanda had said to her.

&gt;**The gods are just**, thought Sansa. Robb had died at a **wedding feast** as well. It was Robb she wept for. Him and Margaery. Poor Margaery, twice **wed** and twice widowed. Sansa slid her arm from a sleeve, pushed down the gown, and wriggled out of it. **She balled it up and shoved it into the bole of an oak, shook out the clothing she had hidden there.** Dress warmly, Ser Dontos had told her, and dress dark. She had no blacks, so she chose **a dress of thick brown wool. The bodice was decorated with freshwater pearls, though. *The cloak will cover them. The cloak was a deep green, with a large hood*. She slipped the dress over her head, and donned the cloak, though she left the hood down for the moment. There were shoes as well, simple and sturdy, with flat heels and square toes. The gods heard my prayer, she thought. She felt so numb and dreamy. My skin has turned to porcelain, to ivory, to steel. Her hands moved stiffly, awkwardly**, as if they had never let down her hair before. For a moment she wished Shae was there, to help her with **the net**.

&gt;When **she pulled it free**, her long auburn hair cascaded down her back and across her shoulders.… (SOS San V)

Holy motif memories. Where to begin?

Sansa has her clothing hidden just where Theon remembers—*during ""Arya's"" wedding*—hiding his treasures as a youth: in the bole of an oak.

Standing next to the bole of this oak, Sansa's hands get clumsy and stiff, *exactly as they do when she is wed to Tyrion.* Not once, but twice.

Sansa repeatedly thinks of the gods, as you should at your wedding, finally thanking them for hearing her prayer.

She thinks of three different weddings.

Then she takes off her Stark-colored garments—symbolically her maiden marriage clothes and probably literally her wedding shoes, given the remark about the new shoes being ""simple and sturdy"", which would certainly be remarkable if she'd just removed the elegant but impractical ""slippers of soft grey doeskin that hugged her feet like lovers"" she'd worn at her wedding—balls them up (as Sandor balls up the green cloak Arya gives him, and as she balled up her bloody sheets when she ""summoned"" Sandor) and put them in the bole of an oak, textually the very spot in which Theon thinks about hiding things during the only Northern wedding we've witnessed thus far in ASOIAF.

Whether Sansa's oak *is* the Red Keep's heart tree ""in world"" or not is almost irrelevant: the ""bole &amp; oak"" verbiage means there's no mistaking that this shit *symbolically* takes place in front of the godswood's heart tree .

- And what does Sansa put on (besides practical shoes)?

A dress of ""thick brown wool"" that recalls Sandor's preference for brown garments, ""plain"" and ""roughspun"" (i.e. wool).

Just so we don't miss the symbolism here, since Sansa's not wearing a cloak to begin with, there are ""freshwater pearls"" on the dress, just as her maiden's cloak was ""heavy with pearls"". It's foregrounded that these maiden's cloak-esque pearls will shortly be covered by the hood of her cloak, which just so happens to be green *like Sandor's favored green cloak and mantle*.

To be sure, Sansa hasn't literally gotten ahold of Sandor's old green cloak (although that doesn't mean this cloak *isn't* literally Sandor's, either—see below). It's that she is replacing her Stark dress with Sandor's brown roughspun and covering up a symbolic vestige of her pearl-laden maiden's cloak with the huge hood (like the huge hood of Sandor's soot-grey cloak) of her Sandor-green cloak, thereby replacing her symbolic maiden's garb/cloak with a figurative bride's cloak (and dress) in Sandor's *personal* colors.

And again: this all takes place before the ""bole"" of an oak in a godswood whose heart tree is an oak whose ""bole"" has been called out in our story.

Meanwhile, Sansa's ""numb and dreamy"" feel mirrors the pointedly odd sensibility Theon has during the wedding of Sansa's supposed sister at Winterfell (when his mind wanders to the things that can be hidden in the bole of an ancient oak):
&gt;[Theon] had never seen the godswood like this, though—**grey and ghostly, filled with warm mists and floating lights and whispered voices that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere.** (DWD PoW)

Sansa's skin turning figuratively to ""steel""—
&gt;My skin has turned to porcelain, to ivory, to steel.

—sounds like armor, right? This reminds us of what transpires between Tyrion and Sansa *on their wedding night,* just before she disrobes:
&gt;""Courtesy is a lady's armor,"" Sansa said. Her septa had always told her that.

&gt;""I am your husband. You can take off your armor now."" (SOS S III)

Same motif, rejiggered for a new ""wedding""? (Her ""steel"" skin also recalls Sandor pairing his green cloak with his armor.)

When Sansa ""stiffly, awkwardly"" removes her bejeweled hair net, this simultaneously recalls the removal of her bejeweled maiden's cloak at her wedding to Tyrion and her ""fumbling"" disrobing for its consummation.

As she panics about the missing jewel, we get *another* callback to her fumbling on her wedding night:
&gt;She tried to stop, but **her fingers were not her own.** (SOS S V)

Dontos shows up, and his conversation with Sansa—
&gt;**""Who's there?"" she cried. ""Who is it?"" The godswood was dim and dark, and the bells were ringing** Joff into his grave.

&gt;**""Me.""** He staggered out from under the trees, reeling drunk. **He caught her arm** to steady himself. **""Sweet Jonquil, I've come. Your Florian has come, don't be afraid.""** (SOS S V)

—neatly recalls the formula for a northern wedding in a godswood—
&gt;**""Who comes?""** [Ramsay's] lips were moist, his neck red above his collar. **""Who comes before the god?""**

&gt;Theon answered. ""Arya of House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown and flowered, trueborn and noble, she comes to beg the blessings of the gods. **Who comes to claim her?**""

&gt;**""Me,"" said Ramsay. ""Ramsay of House Bolton, Lord of the Hornwood, heir to the Dreadfort.** I claim her."" (DWD PoW)

—even as the godswood is emphasized and ""bells were ringing"", ""wedding bells"" being a ""Thing"" in our world if not in Westeros. (Dontos grabbing Sansa's arm is notable becauase it smells like both a groom ""claim[ing]"" his bride *and* like Theon walking ""arm in arm"" with ""Arya"" to be claimed by Ramsay before Winterfell's heart tree.)

Sansa thinks of how Joff ""had been her gallant prince"", and then we read this tantalizing exchange:
&gt;""Come, we must away, they'll search for you. **Your husband's been arrested.**""

&gt;""Tyrion?"" she said, shocked.

&gt;**""Do you have another husband?** The Imp, the dwarf uncle, she thinks he did it."" (ibid)

Well? *Does* she? She's certainly about to. At least figuratively.

Her symbolic wedding to Sandor is completed, even as she thinks of almost *nothing* but marriage:
&gt;If Tyrion did it, they will think I was part of it as well, she realized with a start of fear. How not? **They were man and wife**, and Joff had killed her father and mocked her with her brother's death. **One flesh, one heart, one soul.**

&gt;""Be quiet now, my sweetling,"" said Dontos. ""Outside **the godswood**, we must make no sound. **Pull up your hood and hide your face."" Sansa nodded, and did as he said.** (ibid)

We're explicitly still in the godswood here, and what happens? Sansa at last raises her Sandor-ish hood and thus *covers her maiden cloak-esque pearls,* symbolically subsuming a symbol of her maiden cloak with a symbolic Sandor's-bride's cloak.

Moments later, Dontos throws up from drinking too much wine and reveals he has for once dressed as a knight. I can't think of any other drunks with a fraught relationship with knighthood, can you?

##Sansa's Sandor Chastity Belt
It's pretty plain that Sansa and Sandor are symbolically married in the godswood, *not* when Sansa merely huddles in the Kingsguard cloak Sandor discarded.

So in-world, where does Sansa get this symbolic Sandor wedding cloak she wears?

Before I address the *amazingly cool* literal answer to that question, notice that Sansa is given something quite similar immediately after she balls up and tries to burn the evidence of her menstrual blood, thus performing an inadvertent (figurative?) bloodmagic ritual to protect her from Joffrey and ""summon"" a protector:
&gt;In the end it took three of them to pull her away. And it was all for nothing. The bedclothes were burnt, but by the time they carried her off her thighs were bloody again. It was as if her own body had betrayed her to Joffrey, unfurling a banner of Lannister crimson for all the world to see.

&gt;When the fire was out, they carried off the singed featherbed, fanned away the worst of the smoke, and brought up a tub. Women came and went, muttering and looking at her strangely. They filled the tub with scalding hot water, bathed her and washed her hair and gave her a cloth to wear between her legs. By then Sansa was calm again, and ashamed for her folly. **The smoke had ruined most of her clothing. One of the women went away and came back with *a green wool shift* that was almost her size. ""It's not as pretty as your own things, but it will serve,"" she announced when she'd pulled it down over Sansa's head.** ""Your shoes weren't burned, so at least you won't need to go barefoot to the queen."" (COK S IV)

Her ""green wool shift"" isn't a cloak, to be sure, but it's a fascinating object of inquiry, as I'll explain.

GRRM is a nerd and knows his medieval fabrics and clothing. The term ""shift"" as it was classically used prior to the 19th century meant a sort of loose undergarment. It was basically the original underwear, before underwear was sexy.

Shift began to be replaced by the term ""chemise"" when shift started to have indecent connotations. Chemise and shift became essentially interchangeable, centuries before either was stylish or sexy or the ""shift dress"" became a Thing. Wikipedia and some online dictionaries even redirect searches for shift as clothing to ""chemise"".

But what else is a chemise?
&gt;In medieval castles the chemise (French: ""shirt"") was typically a low wall encircling the keep, protecting the base of the tower. (wikipedia)

Now, the whole point of the ""cloak ceremony"" is to take the bride from ""her father's protection to her husband's"", right? (SOS Ty VIII) And here Sansa is given a Sandor-colored-and-fabric-ed green wool ""shift"" AKA ""chemise"" AKA ""low wall encircling the keep, protecting the base of the tower.""

This, in a world in which ""come-into-my-castle"" is a thing, in which its inherent winking allusion to sex has been lately… well… *winked* at by Tyrion and Penny:
&gt;""When you were a little girl, did you ever play come-into-my-castle?""

&gt;""No. Can you teach me?"" (DWD Ty IX)

(Also a Thing mentioned in the same breath, by the way? ""Hide-the-treasure"", a la Theon and his oak bole.) Symbolically, then, Sansa basically just got a figurative, comfortable chastity belt in Sandor's color and fabric. She is symbolically protected by Sandor, just as a woman is symbolically protected by her husband after their wedding ceremony. Figuratively, then, the shift could be said to be doing the job a wedding cloak might do. More precisely, perhaps, it symbolically safeguards her chastity from the threat it faces from her marriage to Tyrion and preserves it until she can enact her simultaneously figurative-but-true marriage to Sandor *and perhaps ultimately consummate it.*

The shift's link with Sandor may be ironically emphasized by the woman who gives it to her:
&gt;""It's not as pretty as [Sansa's] own things, but **it will serve.**""

As ugly dogs faithfully do.

Pretty nifty stuff. But I still haven't told you where Sansa gets the symbolic bride's cloak in Sandor's color she puts on in the godswood.

##A Dye Job
Thanks to /u/aowshadow, who directed me to [this post about Sandor's bloody Kingsguard cloak](https://ladygwynhyfvar.wordpress.com/2013/11/16/the-bloody-cloak/), I actually think it's pretty clear that the cloak Sansa puts on in the godswood is in fact *Sandor's bloody Kingsguard cloak,* which Sansa has now *dyed dark green* in order to obscure its blood stains. (If this somehow isn't the literal, in-world truth, it's *absolutely* the figurative truth, given all of what follows.)

Consider first that we're told early in ASOS that she has *kept* Sandor's cloak:
&gt;**She had his stained white cloak hidden in a cedar chest** beneath her summer silks. She could not say why she'd kept it. (SOS San I)

The cloak then disappears, but after Alayne flees King's Landing with nothing but the clothes on her back—viz. her deep, dark green cloak and brown wool dress—she thinks of it in a way that's at least consistent with her still owning it:
&gt;[Sandor] took a song and a kiss, and **left me nothing but a bloody cloak.** (FFC Ala II)

Sandor's abandoned Kingsguard cloak is specifically (a) bloody and (b) *wool*, right?
&gt;She found his cloak on the floor, twisted up tight, **the white wool stained by blood and fire**.

Now, recall that in AGOT, Arya ruins Sansa's ""ivory silk dress"" (i.e. a white dress that sounds like a real-world wedding dress) with the ""red"" juices of a *blood* orange—
&gt;""Liar,"" Arya said. Her hand clenched the **blood orange** so hard that **red juice oozed** between her fingers.

&gt;""Go ahead, call me all the names you want,"" Sansa said airily. ""You won't dare when I'm married to Joffrey. You'll have to bow to me and call me Your Grace."" She shrieked as Arya flung the orange across the table. It caught her in the middle of the forehead with a wet squish and plopped down into her lap. 

&gt;""You have juice on your face, Your Grace,"" Arya said.

&gt;It was running down her nose and stinging her eyes. Sansa wiped it away with a napkin. **When she saw what the fruit in her lap had done to her beautiful ivory silk dress, she shrieked again.** (GOT S III)

—causing Sansa to ""ball up"" the dress and throw it into her fireplace—
&gt;The blood orange had left a blotchy red stain on the silk. ""I hate her!"" she screamed. **She balled up the dress and flung it into the cold hearth, on top of the ashes of last night's fire.** (ibid.)

—*exactly* as she does with her bloody bedsheets (which so clearly evoke the ""bloody sheet"" from a maiden's wedding night)—
&gt;She pulled the torn sheet from the bed, and the stained blanket as well. I'll have to burn them. **She balled up the evidence, stuffed it in the fireplace,** drenched it in oil from her bedside lamp, and lit it afire. (COK S IV)

—and very much as she does her Stark-ish maiden's clothing in the godswood—
&gt;**She balled [her gown] up and shoved it into the bole of an oak, shook out the clothing she had hidden there.**

—when it is metaphorically transformed by the tree into the brown wool dress and ""*deep* green"" cloak, which she chose specifically because Dontos said to *""dress dark""*.

Now, what does Sansa do with her white real-world-wedding-style dress stained ""red"" with ""blood"" (orange) *after* she shoves it into the ""ashes of last night's fire""—""ashes"" immediately reminding us of Sandor's ""soot-grey garments and of Sandor's shadow being called *""dark as ash""*? (GOT B III) *She dyes it a darker color to hide the ""blood"" stains!*
&gt;Her gown was the ivory silk that the queen had given her, the one Arya had ruined, but **she’d had them dye it black and you couldn’t see the stain at all.** (GOT S V)

Dye is foregrounded throughout ASOIAF. We read of dyers and dye over and again. (The first time is when Dany sees a cloth trader buying some *green* dye. [GOT Dae VI])

Bloodstains that have been partially cleaned out of white wool are often brown-ish with, as ladygwynhyfvar's essay points out, a greenish hue. Recall that the cloak Sandor wore to tourney was ""olive-green"". Sansa having Sandor's Kingsguard cloak dyed a deep, dark, perhaps olive shade of green to hide the bloodstains perfectly pays off the throwaway detail of her dying her stained ""wedding"" dress, and transforms a cloak that was wholly unsuitable to be a figurative bride's cloak symbolizing Sandor Clegane into the apt metaphor we see in the Kingswood.

A final symbolic connection seals it. Remember how the green roughspun clothing Sandor wears when he reverses his colors to disguise himself is called ""splotchy""?
&gt;…the Hound himself was garbed in **splotchy green roughspun**

Guess when else green things are explicitly ""splotchy"" in ASOIAF? When they're the hands *of a dyer's apprentice,* as seen *under an oak tree!*
&gt;They found Lommy where they'd left him, **under the oak.** ""I yield,"" he called out at once when he saw them. He'd flung away his own spear and raised his hands, **splotchy green with old dye.** (COK A V)

GRRM, everyone!

Sandor is a huge man. Only Gregor is bigger. He's Sansa's benchmark for size:
&gt;The Lord of Runestone stood as tall as the Hound. (FFC Al I)

Thus his cloak would have been *way* too big for Sansa, but (a) it's foregrounded that it could be torn when Sandor tears it off and discards it—
&gt;**Sansa heard cloth ripping** followed by the softer sound of retreating footsteps. (COK S VII)

—and (b) as ladygwynhyfvar notes, Sansa spends half of ASOS sewing—
&gt;[Margaery's] cousins took Sansa into their company as if they had known her all their lives. **They spent long afternoons doing needlework** and talking over lemon cakes and honeyed wine… (SOS S II)

—so she certainly could have made herself a suitably-sized cloak out of the fabric.

What ladygwynhyfvar misses is that there's a very good chance Sansa's ""thick brown wool"" dress with the pearls on the bodice was crafted using fabric from Sandor's huge, bloodstained cloak as well, dyed *brown* to hide the blood and decorated with pearls taken from her maiden's cloak. Sandor's cloak could easily provide sufficient fabric for a Sansa-sized cloak *and dress,* and it just so happens that Sansa's ability to sew a dress is foregrounded *when Arya portentously ruins Sansa's white dress with the ""red"" ""blood"" of an orange:*
&gt;""Washing won't do any good,"" Sansa said. ""Not if you scrubbed all day and all night. The silk is ruined.""

&gt;""Then I'll … make you a new one,"" Arya said.

&gt;Sansa threw back her head in disdain. **""You? You couldn't sew a dress fit to clean the pigsties.""** (GOT S III)

It makes sense that Sandor's abandoned cloak might be notably thick wool. After all we've see Meryn Trant, Jaime Lannister and Arys Oakheart all wear ""heavy wool"" Kingsguard cloaks, and when Sandor throws his cloak around Sansa the first time, after the riot—
&gt;The coarse weave was scratchy against her skin, but no velvet had ever felt so fine. (COK S III)

—it sounds thicker than thinner (and not at all like silk). (GOT San IV; SOS Jai VIII; FFC tSK)

Thus when Sansa dons her figurative bride's cloak and a dress that causes her to more completely mirror Sandor's green-and-brown color scheme, the garments are likely *both* made out of Sandor's cloak, bringing the overarching wedding metaphor all the more sharply into focus.

With Fire and Blood out, it's safe to say that we've gotten most of the information we'll ever get from Martin on the Dance of the Dragons. It's a war that's been given a lot of attention--not least because it'll be referenced in Winds of Winter when Dany hears of Aegon--and has a lot of in-universe impact as being the near-end of the time of dragons. The consensus on the conflict by the fandom, however, has been that it's something Martin wrote to make readers hate both sides. If the Blackfyres were meant to have a romantic tragedy element to some of them, then the Greens and Blacks are to be seen as terrible people who burnt the Realm, killed thousands, and caused the temporary extinction of a species for their own sakes.

But there's a problem with this depiction.

In fact, I'll go so far as to argue that the Dance of Dragons is one of Martin's weakest elements in the entire ASOIAF series. Not because neither side is likeable, I would argue Martin wrote the war hoping we would identify more with individuals than 'sides', but because his own message is undermined by how he's written them. It's the same with the Blackwoods and Brackens; he wants us to think it's a tragedy that neither side can put down their weapons, but he ends up writing one side as better than the other.

In the Dance of Dragons, both Greens and Blacks burnt Westeros, but at least the Blacks could dance.

Allow me to detail my case. 

**The Steps**

The conflict is meant to be more than just an argument of whether the eldest child, even if they're a girl, or the eldest son inherits and that even if Rhaenyra is legitimate, her very actions disqualify her. Both she and Aegon are meant to be equally ill-suited for the throne.

But at the very beginning, Martin depicts one as evil but determined and the other as just plain awful. When Viserys I dies, Rhaenyra is on Dragonstone giving birth in what many characters call ""the woman's battlefield."" Aegon? Whether it's getting a blowjob from a 12 year old or some other carnal act, it's telling that the most favourable account has him protest only to be easily cowed by his mother. In reality, we can assume he grasped for that chair like there was no tomorrow.

And what of precedent? The Greens' first action is not to cite the precedent of the Great Council and that it may override the whims of a single King. There is no attempt at establishing an genuine narrative for the group outside of Criston Cole's oh-so-wonderful summation that women don't get to rule, and that gays are disgusting. Viserys' body is hidden away to rot while the Master of Coin is murdered by the Lord Commander. Tyland Lannister goes crude-Machiavelli in claiming that oaths after twenty or so years don't really count any more. It's only later that they create an actual narrative.

For modern readers, already inclined to support the principle of the Blacks in that the eldest child should inherit regardless of gender, Martin doesn't do much to convince us that the Greens aren't just the villains of the piece. If Martin wanted to depict the Blacks as descending to the level of the Greens, I could buy it, but there's little to suggest that this was his intention.

The Blacks, however, start out as underdogs and take bold steps to make alliances. Throughout most of the pre-Blood and Cheese era, the Blacks take heroic-coded actions while the Greens act like the villains. It's a dynamic that colours a lot of the battles of the war as well. As noted by u/Vikingkingq aka Race For The Iron Throne, the Greens often win only by treachery, luck, or the intervention of foreign allies. IIRC, Daeron is among the only senior Green to secure a straight victory on his own while Aemond mostly sticks to using his dragon--Vhaegar, the biggest and deadliest of the dragons--to terrorise villages and get his uncle's attention.

It's rather like how the Blackwoods are blood of the First Men, keep to the Old Gods, marry Starks and have other 'good-guy' coded traits while the Brackens are often portrayed as being on the 'wrong side'. They betray the Blackwoods to support the Ironborn Hoares and often can be found with the lesser Targaryen Kings, starting with Aegon II and going up to even Aegon IV. Martin wants us to see both sides are wrong, but fails to actually follow through on example of equal flaws.

So we have the Greens already appearing like not only the villains, but this points to another problem they face...

**The Dancers**

The Blacks and Greens both have terrible people inside their groups. They commit evils and have evils committed against them. I doubt anyone can look at Rhaenyra and disagree with the conclusion that she would be a female Maegor, nor that Aegon II would have been Robert if Robert lacked his people-skills.

But let's not pretend one side doesn't have the clear advantage when it comes to people of ability and personality.

Think of the Greens; who among them isn't only competent, but has some semblance of a moral-compass? Queen Helaena and her children, Tyland, Daeron Targaryen, and Hobart Hightower are all I have. Larys Strong and Otto Hightower are certainly the silent pillars, but the former is an expy for Littlefinger who spends much of the conflict hiding in the city (years after likely killing his family) and the latter arguably did much to start the civil war in the first place. These are not the foundations of a sympathetic side and Martin means for it that way.

But he wants us to think the same of the Blacks and, well, that's just not happening. The Blacks have the Starks, Manderleys, Tullys, Arryns, and Blackwoods on their side. In short, they have 'the Good Houses' fighting for them. Not only that, but they have Mushroom the Dwarf and the Dragonseeds of which all the bad-sees go over to the Greens eventually. The Blacks appear more representative of Westeros than the Hightower-Westerland clique the Greens end up stuck with.

Of the lords themselves, they have Cregan Stark, Kermit and Elmo Tully, and Benjicott Blackwood and his aunt Aly. And that's ignoring who the Blacks have from within the Crownlands. They have Corlys ""the Sea-Snake"" Velaryon, they have Rhaenys the Queen That Never Was, Rhaenyra's ""Strong Boys"" are all bold and courageous, Daemon's daughters Rhaena and Baella are both admirable women and the latter is an expy of Arya. As for Daemon himself, for all his evil he is never denied as an effective commander and skilled player.

As for the Greens, they start with a full-house and still manage to nearly lose it all on the first hand. Their best dragon-rider is Aemond, who picks fights with and loses to children. Otto Hightower is humiliated by his grandson and is seen by future generations like Maester Pylos as a failure of a Hand. Unwin Peake goes on to plot the murder of children and has a pathetic fall from power.

The less said about Criston 'Got Cucked' Cole, King-Maker and Fedora-Wearer, the better.

To return to the Bracken and Blackwood comparison, it's telling how the Brackens get associated with the likes of Aegon IV, the Blackfyres, and the Greens, while the Blackwoods side with who Martin writes as the good-guys. If Martin is trying to tell a tale of both Greens and Blacks being awful, he could have done better to resolve the disparity in talent and charisma.

But the dissonance between intention and implementation is largest in one particular regard.

**The Climaxes**

One of the lines in ADWD that defines the book, and the series as a whole, is in one of Quentyn's chapters. ""Men's lives have meaning, not their deaths."" Death may colour a perception, but it is how they lived that counts.

But Martin doesn't display that here.

The 'good Greens' get the following deaths; Helaena and her children are murdered or commit suicide in awful ways (and that's assuming Halaena wasn't put through the punishment-by-rape Mushroom claims she suffered), and Daeron is either ambushed or a literal case of ""Rocks fall, everyone dies"". Hobart Hightower gets to die stopping Ulf the White from causing any further suffering, and Tyland Lannister dies dignified in bed, but that's two exceptions in a long and embarrassing line of defeats in battle or executions. The Great Houses that side with the Greens are rewarded by being reduced to being ruled by children and female Regents, and if that's not a repudiation of the Greens' entire casus belli then I don't know what is.

Contrast that with the Blacks. The Strong Boys die tragically, but it's more than just an act of nihilistic spite. Jace dies turning back the Triarchy fleet, Luke perishes against the mightiest dragon, and Joffrey tries to save his dragon. Rhaenys--a woman of fifty-five--almost turns an ambush against her attackers; crippling Aegon II and likely would have slain Aemond and Vhaegar if it was them alone. Again, this was an old woman on a smaller dragon, taken by surprise. Addam Velaryon all but saves King's Landing and destroys any viable independent Green power-base with his last stand, all in the name of redeeming him and his fellow loyal Dragonseeds. Even Celtigar has his son valiantly stand against the mob until stabbed in the back.

One side dies pathetically and the other dies nobly, tragically, honourably. Martin must have known how it would appear.

But the biggest case lies in Daemon Targaryen's death and the death of Aemond and Criston Cole. The former lived his life like an evil Sam Vimes; a filibustering crime-lord who ordered Blood and Cheese. Surely, if Martin wanted to show neither side deserving support, it would be through him. But, instead, he gets something like a love-story (no account offered, not even Mushroom's, challenges this) with Nettles. He stoically goes to his death, challenges Aemond, and dies leaping from his dragon as if he's from a heavy metal album. Aemond, on the other hand, dies because his uncle plays him like a chump and he can't take off his seat-belt in time.

After all Daemon did, he gets to go out like a hero, while Criston Cole is shot by arrows like a normal soldier and told flat-out that he caused the war. I'm not saying Cole didn't play a strong part, but it's telling that one of the more disgusting of the Blacks gets something like true love and to go out a legend, while the best a prominent Green can hope for is to survive the war with all their parts attached.

Even at the end, when both of them are meant to be equally awful and seen as ill-deserving of power, Rhaenyra gets to spit words of defiance before a dragon eats her, while Aegon lingers on in burnt agony, his dragon dead, and making orders out of spite with his cause lost.

Just as the Brackens are often undone by their flirtations with the likes of Harwyn Hoare, the Greens, Aegon IV, and the Blackfyres, they again suffer in ASOIAF. Lord Bracken tries to exploit the loss of a war and the practical subjugation of the Riverlands just to spite the Blackwoods. It's telling that part of Jaime's attempt at redemption is to invert this and instead punish Bracken more, and that he gets the closest thing to a balanced version of the conflict from Hoster Blackwood.

But Martin undermines the messages he tries to invoke with the Brackens and Blackwoods, if on a smaller scale, that he attempts with the Greens and Blacks. It even feels as if the conflict only lasts as long as it does because the dragons must die if they are to be reborn. It's admirable that he didn't want to simply cut-and-paste ""this side is good because they want a Queen."" But rather than create a narrative that challenges the idea of anyone being a rightful ruler on blood alone, Martin simply creates a narrative where we have no faction to support morally, only for all the individuals we wish to get a happy ending to all be on the same side.

In the Dance of Dragons, all of Westeros burnt, but it's hard to escape the image of the Blacks dancing gracefully while the Greens stumble drunkenly about. And, as crude as it may sound, there is a difference when asked who we might prefer.

TLDR; Both are sides terrible, but only one just plain sucks.

We know some of our cherished theories will be shattered, but what if it’s most of them?  What if the story going forward is half as complicated a mystery as we think it must be?

At some point all healthy literary analysis starts to go sour as the mind-blowing theories of these past years circle too far, eat their own tails and start to regurgitate garbage. Have we devoured these books too much, or are there still actual silver and gold nuggets left to find?

R+L=J is a prime example. This was an amazing reveal that was absolutely perfectly plotted by GRRM, but in all the years living with this reveal since readers first put it all together,  some people are inevitably starting to treat R+L=J as if it might be too obvious and too simple compared to some of the grander theories that have germinated since. It’s no wonder even the tinfoil of 2012 is starting to look downright scholarly and well sourced compared to the tinfoil of today.  We’ve lived with GRRM’s many dangling threads so long that some of us have picked them up and weaved some amazingly complex and lovely tapestries that will be hard to un-see when TWOW is finally released.

So, apologies for the length of this, but here’s my existential dilemma, do I think it is even reasonable for GRRM to conjure up even a quarter of all the mind blowing material the fandom has dreamed up since ADWD was released?

But he also gave friendly advice to Jon Snow and showed respect for Maester Aemon and Jeor Mormont. Plus, as Hand of the King, he also sent recruits to the Wall (as well as publicly humiliating Ser Alliser Thorne, for which he should be given a medal).

Here's my point: after whatever villain turn he gets up to in the books or show (I'm leaning towards the show since he's nowhere near as villainous there as in the books), will King Jon, First of His Name, show clemency by sending him to the Wall (whichever Wall exists at the end of the series), where (if he chooses to) he could be the popular Lord Commander who rebuilds the Watch? Leaving, in theory, Jaime to inherit Casterly Rock and continue the Lannister name?  There'd be a kind of symmetry in leaving him where he began... \[edit: as recappers of the Season 8 trailer have noticed, there appears to be a new wall on the map where ice and fire collide... [https://winteriscoming.net/2018/12/07/we-break-down-the-game-of-thrones-season-8-teaser-frame-by-frame/](https://winteriscoming.net/2018/12/07/we-break-down-the-game-of-thrones-season-8-teaser-frame-by-frame/) \]

Wouldn't it be crueller to Tyrion if he were left alive, but condemned for his treachery to spend the rest of his days marooned thousands of miles from the castle he sees as his birthright? Or will he be the one to restore House Lannister's fortunes by, using the knowledge of his crash course in finance which we call his tenure as Master of Coin, opening the First Bank of Westeros? Or will he be offered clemency and snarlingly refuse it, trotting out his famous last words, ""Bugger you all""? (or a variation on Richard III's famous ""a horse, a horse""? ""Fetch me Viserion""?)

tl;dr: I think we all know that the oft-repeated threat in the books that Tyrion might lose his tongue is one of George's famous red herrings. Tyrion can get by without his money, but without his tongue he'd have absolutely no power. It'd be very easy for one of his enemies to, say, tie a cinderblock to his feet and throw him into a latrine -- since violence against dwarfs seems to be regarded in Planetos as either a) comedic or b) a victimless crime. And he's George's openly-professed favourite character... he's gotta keep cracking wise and saying rude things all the way to the end. That tongue's staying in his head.

0,1,0,49,17,"This assumes that R+L=J (which it does. It does.) and that Aegon is a Blackfyre (a neat theory, but not anywhere close to fact). 

Regarding Ned and Illyrio, it's interesting how they are put in a similar situation. Both have essentially a scion of a fallen noble House, the heir apparent of a dynasty that claimed the Iron Throne. Jon is the head of House Targaryen, Aegon the head of House Blackfyre. Both their claims are tenuous at best, having lost a giant civil war, but especially for Jon but also a bit for Aegon, there are people who would want to seat them on the Iron Throne.

So... what do they do? Ned raises Jon as his own, likely never telling anyone of Jon's real heritage to keep him safe. Ned would never dream of pressing Jon's claim to the Throne, partially because Robert is his friend, but also because doing so could very well spell death for Jon. Doing so means relegating Jon to a bastard status, which we see does bother him a lot even if he learns early on that he still had it better than 95% of Westeros. Would Jon have wanted so desperately to leave Winterfell if he knew the truth? Is his life as a brother of the Night's Watch really what Lyanna would have wanted for her son? We can see the compromises and sacrifices Ned made regarding Jon, and I wonder if he died thinking he kept his promise, or if he had any regrets. 

Meanwhile, Varys and Illyrio plot and plot to seat Aegon on the Iron Throne. Aegon is given a High Lord's education, like Jon, but it is specifically to prepare him to be a King. Right now, it looks like they might succeed. Aegon has landed with the Golden Co., he may in fact marry Arianne and get the spears of Dorne behind him, the Faith may choose him over Tommen, and Randyll Tarly might defect to his side with his large army. We may very well see Aegon triumphantly sit on the Iron Throne by the end of *TWOW*, surrounded by cheering crowds. But as Cersei once said, *when you play the game of thrones, you win or you die*. Ready or not, Aegon's a player now. [And he may have made a terrible enemy](https://warsandpoliticsoficeandfire.wordpress.com/2015/05/21/the-dragons-mercy-the-violent-future-path-of-daenerys-targaryen-part-4-the-embers-of-essos/). Assuming Illyrio is Aegon's father, was that the right thing to do? What's more important, Aegon's safety, or his ""birthright""?

I thought it was a really neat idea, so I took a crack at an edit. It's mostly the same as theirs, but with some changes to maybe fit the meter a little better (I'm no musician lol.) Here is my edit of his addition to *The Rains of Castamere*:

Verse 1 - The original

&gt;And who are you, the proud lord said, 

&gt;that I must bow so low? 

&gt;Only a cat of a different coat, 

&gt;that’s all the truth I know. 

&gt;In a coat of gold or a coat of red, 

&gt;a lion still has claws, 

&gt;And mine are long and sharp, my lord, 

&gt;as long and sharp as yours. 

&gt;And so he spoke, and so he spoke, 

&gt;that lord of Castamere, 

&gt;But now the rains weep o’er his hall, 

&gt;with no one there to hear. 

&gt;Yes now the rains weep o’er his hall, 

&gt;and not a soul to hear.
	
Verse 2 - after the Red Wedding

&gt;And who are you, the Young Wolf said,

&gt;that I must bow so low?

&gt;Torrhen knelt to Dragons, aye,

&gt;but that was long ago.

&gt;A Dragon won our solemn oath,

&gt;with fire, blood, and fang.

&gt;Now Lions sit his Iron Throne,

&gt;and I say they can hang!

&gt;And so he spoke, and so he spoke,

&gt;that wolf of Winterfell,

&gt;But now he hunts but for his head,

&gt;with no one left to tell.

&gt;Yes now he hunts but for his head,

&gt;and not a soul to tell.


So, that's my best crack at it. I debated between referencing the wedding specifically and Robb getting his head cut off and replaced with Grey Wind's. I figure the latter was more of an insult to the Starks, so I went with that. Looking back at this, all I can say is *Fuck* the Freys. They deserve Lady Stoneheart's vengeance.

It would be a good idea if the living made thousands of wildfire jars. Then dragonglass shards would be attached to these jars. These jars would be carried by hundreds of ravens controlled by Bran.  
   
  
When dropped from a fair height, these jars would explode, and the force of the explosion would cause the shards to break and fly in all directions which could help take out multiple enemies (including WW) at once.    
  
You could say that the NK could take out the ravens with his javelin skills. But IMO he would be too slow against hundreds of ravens.  
  
The best place to drop these bombs would be where the WW are standing. Because as you know, when a WW is taken all the wights controlled by him drop dead.

0,1,0,32,2,"In this episode with the always excellent LmL, HoW discusses the idea that the Daynes and Hightowers may have descended from a common ancestor to the Valyrians from the GEotD. It’s an excellent episode on an excellent show but one thing has been bugging me about it. 

Their supposition is based largely on Dany’s vision in the House of the Undying where we get a glimpse of the former emperors. They all have hair the colour of precious metal and eyes the colour of gems. The Targs and Daynes for example have silver or platinum hair and amethyst eyes. 

They speculate that they arrived in Westeros’ south east coast and established their houses. Both of which have buildings or relics that are WAAAY beyond what the first-men were supposedly capable of (the base of the Hightower and Dawn) 

All good so far. My problem is this. Why were the Lannisters not included in this speculation? They have hair of beaten gold and eyes of emerald and live in a castle unlike anything else in Westeros. 

They mention the Seastone Chair and Pyke, both supposedly built before the arrival of the First Men, yet don’t consider the house with hair of precious metal and gemstone eyes that lies directly between Oldtown and the Iron Islands. It is also said to have been inhabited before the arrival of the First Men. 

I’m curious what other people who enjoyed the episode think about the idea of counting the Casterlys and by extension, the Lannisters, alongside the Daynes and Hightowers as descendants from the GEotD?

“Tarly.” When he tried to speak, the blood dribbled from the Old Bear’s mouth down into his beard. “Tarly, go. Go.” “Where, my lord?” His voice was flat and lifeless. I am not afraid. It was a queer feeling. “There’s no place to go.” “The Wall. Make for the Wall. Now.” “Now,” squawked the raven. “Now. Now.” The bird walked up the old man’s arm to his chest, and plucked a hair from his beard. “You must. Must tell them.” “Tell them what, my lord?” Sam asked politely. “All. The Fist. The wildlings. Dragonglass. This. All.” His breathing was very shallow now, his voice a whisper. “Tell my son. Jorah. Tell him, take the black. My wish. Dying wish.” “Wish?” The raven cocked its head, beady black eyes shining. “Corn?” the bird asked. “No corn,” said Mormont feebly. “Tell Jorah. Forgive him. My son. Please. Go.” - chapter 33, Samwell


Few things to note:

1. As Jeor died, blood spilled into his beard

2. The Raven repeated ""now"" three times, in relation to Jeor telling Sam to make for the wall

3. The Raven plucked a hair from Jeors beard

4. Five times, the Raven spoke. Three were ""now"", the last two times were questions: ""wish?"" And ""corn?""

The Raven insists that Sam leave for the wall, and plucks a bloody beard hair from Jeor. Then asks Sam for a wish, and then for corn. For a bird that seems to choose it's words, why *WISH*? Why did the Raven take a bloody hair from Jeor's beard?

I know this is probably trivial, but for the life of me I can't shake the feeling there is something hidden here.

0,1,0,8,100,"At first I thought the Doom of Valyria was just a reference to Atlantis and Numenor, but H.P. Lovecraft also wrote a short story about a great civilization that suddenly fell called [the Doom that Came to Sarnath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doom_that_Came_to_Sarnath). A lot of Easter Eggs are in TWOIAF as well.

Not only it is called ""the Doom"", people of Sarnath were also originally shepherds, just like Valyrians.

&gt;After many aeons men came to the land of Mnar; dark **shepherd folk with their fleecy flocks**, who built Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron on the winding river Ai. And certain tribes, more hardy than the rest, pushed on to the border of the lake and built Sarnath at a spot where precious metals were found in the earth. 

They quickly became imperialists and subdued their neighbors with conquest.

&gt;**So Sarnath waxed mighty and learned and beautiful, and sent forth conquering armies to subdue the neighbouring cities**; and in time there sate upon a throne in Sarnath the kings of all the land of Mnar and of many lands adjacent.

They became apex of civilization and built great towers, walls and other architectures like Valyria. Also note that description of chariot passing over walls in used for walls of Volantis.

&gt;**The wonder of the world and the pride of all mankind was Sarnath the magnificent**. Of polished desert-quarried marble were its walls, in height 300 cubits and in breadth 75, **so that chariots might pass each other as men drave them along the top**. (...)

&gt;But more marvellous still were the palaces and the temples, and the gardens made by Zokkar the olden king. There were many palaces, the least of which were mightier than any in Thraa or Ilarnek or Kadatheron. **So high were they that one within might sometimes fancy himself beneath only the sky**; yet when lighted with torches dipt in the oil of Dothur their walls shewed vast paintings of kings and armies, of a splendour at once inspiring and stupefying to the beholder. (...)

&gt;**Lofty and amazing were the seventeen tower-like temples of Sarnath, fashioned of a bright multi-coloured stone not known elsewhere**. A full thousand cubits high stood the greatest among them, wherein the high-priests dwelt with a magnificence scarce less than that of the kings.(...)

&gt;Wonderful likewise were the gardens made by Zokkar the olden king. In the centre of Sarnath they lay, covering a great space and encircled by a high wall. And they were surmounted by a mighty dome of glass, through which shone the sun and moon and stars and planets when it was clear, and from which were hung fulgent images of the sun and moon and stars and planets when it was not clear. 


Some people realized that something was going wrong and fled the city.

&gt;And it was the high-priest Gnai-Kah who first saw the shadows that descended from the gibbous moon into the lake, and the damnable green mists that arose from the lake to meet the moon and to shroud in a sinister haze the towers and the domes of fated Sarnath. Thereafter those in the towers and without the walls beheld strange lights on the water, and saw that the grey rock Akurion, which was wont to rear high above it near the shore, was almost submerged. **And fear grew vaguely yet swiftly, so that the princes of Ilarnek and of far Rokol took down and folded their tents and pavilions and departed for the river Ai, though they scarce knew the reason for their departing.** (...)

&gt;And the princes and travellers, as they fled from the doomed city of Sarnath on horses and camels and elephants, looked again upon the mist-begetting lake and saw the grey rock Akurion was quite submerged.

Anyways, reading Barth's record of Aerea Targaryen in Fire and Blood convinced me that something Lovecraftian was going on with Valyria.

&gt;How could the gods be so blind or so uncaring as to permit such horror? Or is it possible that there are other deities in this universe, monstrous evil gods such as the priests of Red R'hllor preach against, against whose malice the kings of men and the gods of men are naught but flies? (...)

&gt;What befell her on Valyria I cannot surmise. Judgeing from condition in which she returned to us, I do not even care to contemplate it. The Valyrians were more than dragonlords. They practised blood magic and other dark arts as well, delving deep into the earth for secrets best left buried and twisting the flesh of beasts and men to fashion monstrous and unnatural chimeras. For these sins the gods in their wroth struck them down (...)

&gt;The lords of Westeros are proud men, and the septons of the Faith and the maesters of the Citadel in their own ways are prouder still, but there is much more of the nature of the world that we do not understand, and may never understand. Mayhaps that is a mercy.

Yep, sounds like Lovecraft to me.

So I think it's safe to say something similar happened with Valyria. The Valyrians, consumed by their arrogance and greed, used too much magic and dug too deep in the Fourteen Flames (like the Dwarves of Moria from LOTR). After all the mages controlling Fourteen Flames got killed due to Dragonlords backstabbing each other, they woke up some unspeakable eldritch horror and brought doom upon them.

0,1,0,16,0," 1. **Sansa/Alayne marries Harry the Heir**—This one was hinted at previously and a chapter released had Sansa seducing Harry (not literally, but just enough to where she’s in his head). The marriage will probably happen and soon enough Sansa and Littlefinger will have the might of the Vale behind them. Sansa will become a better protégé for Littlefinger, only for her to eventually and probably inevitably turn on an unsuspecting Littlefinger (not in the Show method either).

2. **Bran becomes the Three-Eyed Raven and learns more about the History of Westeros**—As Bran slowly gains the ability to look into the past beyond the Weirwood trees he will slowly learn more about the history of Westeros. The biggest differences are that some other mysteries and greater character development will happen in contrast to the TV version. 

a. **More about Bloodraven**\--We will find out why and how Bloodraven became the Three-Eyed Raven. This also will probably somewhat redeem Aerys I as it will be revealed that he and Bloodraven constantly researched as much as possible about magic leading to Bloodraven becoming the Three-Eyed Raven. Perhaps it will also be revealed that Bloodraven wanted to go the Wall and eventually beyond the Wall in his pursuit of becoming the Three-Eyed Raven. 

There may also be some heavy allusions to the Tragedy of Summerhall with Bloodraven expressing regret that he was not there, as he knew he could have helped prevent the disaster. We will not get the answer to what exactly happened in Summerhall, but we will get even more teases.

b. **Ned and Asha will be Explained/Revealed--**The mystery of who were Jon Snow’s parents will probably be revealed, but just prior to that we will get an explanation on what happened between Ned and Ashara Dayne. Ashara Dayne was a tantalizing red herring thrown out as Jon’s mother, with Ned not liking the rumor at all. Ned being Ned never reflects on Ashara Dayne, but at the same time is uncomfortable with her being brought-up. Some crazy (but really fun) theories suggest that Ned married Ashara during the Tournament of Harrenhall, and that Ashara may have indeed given birth to a child as Barristan the Bold believes. So, maybe it will be revealed that Ned is going to deny his bigamy and remain loyal to Catelyn which leads to Ashara committing suicide. We will find out that fateful final conversation between Ned and Ashara. It will certainly be one really momentous and ugly conversation that will weigh heavily forever on Ned. Ned will probably be uncomfortable to have Ashara’s name brought up regardless of the bastard rumors. 

c. **R+L=J**—This is the one that everyone suspects and the TV show seemed to confirm for the books. At this point fans that deny Jon Snow is Rhaegar and Lyanna’s son are considered the ones with crazy fan theories. I am probably going to lean on agreeing with most and say that Jon really isn’t Ned’s bastard (though I do like the theory that Ned did have another child in the above theory). Uunlike the show, we will probably actually see some romantic scenes as well as the actual “abduction” of Lyanna by Rhaegar. This may also reveal some of the Targaryen madness/greatness in Rhaegar. While Rhaegar loves Lyanna, he probably was guided to her by his obsession with the Prince who was Promised prophecy. Joining the Targaryens and Starks supposedly fulfills the Song of Ice &amp; Fire. That being said, I don’t know if they will go for the Rhaegar was the legitimate wife of Lyanna and annulled his marriage aspect. If anything, I think the simple justification of being like Aegon and Maegor of marrying more than one woman. So, maybe Jon Targaryen, not another Aegon Targaryen.

d. **The Origins of the Others**—Just like the show, but probably some more details.

e. **Hold the Door**—What may end up starting Bran to search deeper into the history of his own family.

3. **Jaime will join Lady Stoneheart**—Jaime will be brought before Lady Stoneheart. He will not only beg for his life, but he may end up so frustrated by his sister that he ends up asking to join the Brotherhood Without Banners. It would be a surprising turn but it is actually a fairly logical progression of Jaime’s continuing journey of finding his nobility and trying to help the people more than just being consumed with self-loathing and resentment. 

4. **Lady Stoneheart will resurrect Jon**—So, this is my insistent theory. I think the ultimate culmination of Catelyn’s journey is her coming to not only accept Jon, but give her life for Jon. We have already had Beric Dondarrion transfer his life over to Catelyn, and I think either the middle or climax of the book will be Lady Stoneheart arriving at the Wall to bring back Jon.

5. **Jon Survives in Ghost**—While Jon’s human body rots in the snow he will follow previous wargs of transferring his mind into Ghost. Unfortunately this may end up causing him to slowly return more wolf-like when he comes back, but that’s part of how Jon’s resurrection will affect him just as much as it affects Beric and Catelyn.

6. **Clegane Bowl**—We all want it, and I think it will happen. Sandor survived his wounds and becomes a member of the Faith Militant. He serves as the Faith’s champion against “Ser Robert”. But, continuing the subversion of expectations, the Mountain kills the Hound. 

7. **Arya is the Valonqar**—The “valonqar” mystery is a part of the prophecy that will obviously receive payoff. As much as some fans will clamor for either Jaime or Tyrion to kill Cersei, I have a sneaking feeling that Arya will appear to Cersei as Jaime and strangle Cersei. It will be the perfect crescendo to the downfall of Cersei. Just as she manages to survive her humiliation by the High Sparrow and a trial by combat, she will suddenly be killed by Arya who she sees as her beloved Jaime. 

8. **Aegon/Young Griff will Sit on the Iron Throne**—So I know the internet is divided on whether this teenager saying he is Prince Aegon is genuine. This will partly be Martin’s analysis of how relevant actually being a claimant to the throne is to people following you. Personally, I think this is the real Aegon, but as the story will show it does not really matter if he is fake. Aegon will win battles and that will gain him more allies. All the while Cersei and the Tyrells bicker amongst each other dooming Tommen to lose the Iron Throne.

a. **Dorne will ally with Aegon**—Arianne might or might not marry/become engaged to Aegon, but the main point will be that Aegon will gain the huge support from Dorne that Tyrion expected Aegon would receive. Aegon will be up for marrying Arianne, though he will be concerned about Myrcella being held in Dorne, which Arianne will persuade him to spare Myrcella. 

b. **The Faith Militant Will Ally with Aegon**—So in perfect irony to the struggle between Maegor and the Faith Militant, Cersei surviving a Trial by Combat and regaining her power as Regent will spur members of the Faith Militant to declare for Aegon. Aegon will gain hundreds of allies just as Varys had hoped. Aegon is seen as a savior rather than a conqueror. They will open the gates to Aegon just as he approaches King’s Landing with Aegon coming into the city unopposed.

c. **Aegon VI’s Gets Unwelcome News**—We will get to what happens in the North in just a bit, but suffice it to say that just as Aegon is crowned Aegon VI and debating what to do with Cersei he will get an envoy (maybe Melissandre herself) who reveals the fall of the Wall and the invasion of the Others with Jon offering an alliance.

d. **Connington will be Replaced by the Alchemist**—Connington’s greyscale was given to Jorah in the show, but I have a nagging suspicion that the character of the Alchemist is going to take the opportunity to swap with Connington in Oldtown and return as Connington cured.

9. **Tommen is poisoned**—The Sand Snakes will continue to spy and manipulate the growing rivalry and distrust among the Lannisters and the Tyrells. As Aegon marches on King’s Landing Tommen will “mysteriously” die by the work of Tyene. Unlike the show having Myrcella poisoned, it’s Tommen who will meet his end by poison. 

10. **Stannis defeats Ramsay**—Stannis and Ramsay’s armies are crumbling apart before their eyes. I like the theory by everyone that Stannis will trap Ramsay’s forces on the frozen lake. However, Ramsay will survive using Melissandre’s amulet to disguise himself as Rattleshirt, where he will plot his vengeance.

11. **The Wall and North are at War**—The Wall and the Wildlings will end up warring with one another over the outrage of Jon’s death. This will all just add to the painful irony that the real war of the Other’s invading is being ignored.

a. **Stannis Sacrifices Asha**—Before Stannis does go for the sacrifice of his own daughter, he will probably be prudent enough to try the blood magic on Asha Greyjoy. The sacrifice will probably cause something to happen that convinces him to go all the way and sacrifice Shireen.Unlike the show, this will cause Lightbringer to become a truly magical sword. But then something bad will happen.

b. **Ramsay kills Stannis**—Ramsay disguised as Rattleshirt will kill an unsuspecting Stannis just as he gains the means to fight the Others and is slowly rallying men to his cause. It also will mirror the magical and unexpected death of Renly.

c. **Theon kills Ramsay**—Theon will get to overcome his fear of Ramsay by killing him after the unexpected death of Stannis. 

d. **King Jon Stark**—Just as things are looking hopeless, that’s when Cat will show up to bring back Jon. Just before Lady Stoneheart resurrects Jon, she will reveal that one of Robb’s last acts was to legitimize Jon, Ghost-Jon will hear this and not like it, but Jon will be resurrected and hailed as the King in the North.

12. **The Myrenese Knot**—Just like the War in the North and the South, the War in the East will be ugly with everything becoming a mess. 

a. **Tyrion on the Council**—Tyrion will have the Second Sons defect once more to Daenerys’ side with Tyrion being able to gain a position on Barristan’s council. Unfortunately, the war will not be that simple.

b. **Victarion Gains the Dragons**—The Dragon Horn plot is one hell of a turn that might be a major factor in the war. Just as it seems like the Slavers will surrender to Barristan, Victarion is going to show up and use the horn to gain control over Viserion and Rheagal. Naturally Dany will not be pleased by this when she finds out. Victarion frustrated that Dany is not there will leave with the Dragons and try to take Westeros for himself. Unfortunately for everyone, he will quickly lose the dragons and his life. 

c. **Great Khalessi Daenerys**—Dany will probably gain control of a Khalassar and arrive to wipe out the Slavers armies. Unfortunately, she will arrive to find Viserion and Rhaegal gone. Her return to sit back in Myr will come with news of Aegon VI coming to sit on the Iron Throne. She will set out to aide her nephew(?) not aware of what has happened to her dragons or the Wall.

13. **The Others**—As the idiotic humans play their moronic game of thrones, the Others having taken over ships in Hardhome begin to sail for the Iron Islands. They arrive in time to find Victarion Greyjoy. They are able to easily use the Dragon horn and gain control of Viserion and Rhaegal. Just as King Jon and King Aegon find themselves on their respective thrones and Dany is sailing on ships, the Others destroy the Wall. ",1,(Spoilers Extended) The Winds of Winter Predictions,11509,51

# The Heart of Winter

## The horrifying end of Aerea Targaryen



&gt;“All the maester’s arts were powerless against her **fever**, if indeed we can call such a horror by such a commonplace name.” -Fire &amp; Blood



But we know that even if it’s a fever it’s not contagious. At least not at this stage.



&gt;“the poor child was **cooking from within**. Her flesh grew darker and darker and then began to crack, until her skin resembled nothing so much, Seven save me, as pork cracklings.” -Fire &amp; Blood


So, kinda like someone being transformed through fire. And I say transformed because she is not dead yet.


&gt;“I thought that was the most hideous thing that I should ever see, but I was quickly disabused of the notion, for a worse horror was awaiting me. That came when Benifer and I lowered the poor child into a tub and **covered her with ice**. The shock of that immersion **stopped her heart at once**,” -Fire &amp; Blood


So now she’s dead, but only because of ice… wait what?



And then a lot of little monsters( Firewyrms) come out of the body. And of course they’re firewyrms because their description matches the description of the firewyrms almost word by word.



&gt;“I do not know how to speak of them…they were…worms with faces…snakes with hands…twisting, slimy, unspeakable things that seemed to writhe and pulse and squirm as they came bursting from her flesh.” -Fire &amp; Blood



&gt;”Some were no bigger than my little finger, but one at least was as long as my arm” -Fire &amp; Blood


&gt;""Firewyrms. Some say they are akin to dragons, for wyrms breathe fire too. Instead of soaring through the sky, they bore through stone and soil. If the old tales can be believed, there were wyrms amongst the Fourteen Flames even before the dragons came. The young ones are no larger than that skinny arm of yours, but they can grow to monstrous size and have no love for men."" AFFC - Arya II 


Okay, but now it gets more interesting:


&gt;“Whatever they might have been, they were  **creatures of heat and fire**, and **they did not love the ice, oh no**. One after another they thrashed and writhed and died before my eyes,” -Fire &amp; Blood


These words next to each other cannot be random. Creatures of heat and fire who did not love ice! Okay, we’re getting somewhere.


&gt;“From the very start we have asked, Where did Aerea take Balerion? We should have been asking, **Where did Balerion take Aerea?**” -Fire &amp; Blood


So why would Balerion go back to a wasteland? We know that Balerion is possibly the only living thing that remembers Valryia. We also know that a skinchanger slowly dissolves into their second skin and after sometime the “skin” takes back control. So Balerion has been riderless and we could assume that he remembers things, knows things. Maybe a threat or an unfinished business before he is completely useless and cannot even fly around a city.


And after return:

&gt;“jagged rent down his left side almost **nine feet long**, a gaping red wound from which his blood still dripped, hot and smoking.” -Fire &amp; Blood

The emphasis is on the length of the wound. This means that the wound was not inflicted by a human or a human blade.


&gt;“It was subsequent to this that Barth began the researches and investigations that would ultimately lead him to write Dragons, Wyrms, and Wyverns: Their Unnatural History, a volume that the Citadel would condemn as “provocative but unsound” and that Baelor the Blessed would order expunged and destroyed.” -Fire &amp; Blood


So there were more information delivered by Barth but the absolute dumbest and worst person in the entire story is responsible for their disappearance. Is there a deeper reason why he ordered this? Probably not, he’s an extremist nutcase. But from the title of the book we can assume that the link between the dragons and firewyrms were drawn by Barth because of the incident that happened to Aerea. And from this we can assume that there were experiments being done on living things.


What happened to Aerea was not a one time incident and is what got out of hands and destroyed Vlyria.


All of this is considering that the story is certainly a post-apocalyptic story where knowledge, history, and advancements have been lost. Not only because of the doom of Valyria but because Vlyrians are told to have been sheepherders before becoming genetic modifying dragon-riders. It’s mentioned that the Vlyrians learned their arts from more mysterious people. Not only that but it is said that there has been dragon bones in Westeros from a time before there were humans there ( Which is irrelevant because there could have been people and dragons before it was emptied).

## A wall of ice



&gt;“Silverwing “does not like this Wall.” Though it was summer and the Wall was weeping, the chill of the ice could still be felt whenever the wind blew, and every gust would make the dragon hiss and snap. “Thrice I flew Silverwing high above Castle Black, and thrice I tried to take her north beyond the Wall,” Alysanne wrote to Jaehaerys, “but every time she veered back south again and refused to go. Never before has she refused to take me where I wished to go.” -Fire &amp; Blood

We’ve always had suspensions as to why Silverwing couldn’t pass the wall. Now considering what we’ve read above we might know exactly why. Let’s add that this visit takes place during the summer and it’s the only time a dragon has gone that far to the north. And if it was winter time no dragon could reach even that far. So just like how a tub of ice stopped Aerea’s heart and monsters, a bigger tub of ice could stop Silverwing’s heart and she is not willing to let that happen.

Now let’s visit an older quote:

&gt;“Can a bird hate? Jon had slain the wilding Orell, but some part of the man remained within the eagle. The golden eyes looked out on him with cold malevolence.” -ASOS - Jon II


And now for the reverse. 


&gt;The sound was shocking, ear-piercing, thick with agony. Varamyr fell, writhing, and the 'cat was screaming too . . . and high, high in the eastern sky, against the wall of cloud, Jon saw the eagle burning. For a heartbeat it flamed brighter than a star, - ASOS - Jon X

Because it's not winter yet, and not cold enough. because a certain species should pass through there and bring the winter over before Orell's eagle could pass.

## What is dead may never die but rises again, harder and stronger

Disclaimer: I don’t have quotes or passages for this part and this is my personal answer to the puzzle.


Everything is burning, the people and the lands. Fire-walker creature monsters and worms are multiplying through corpses and dominating. This is the result of some failed experiment or a weapon of mass destruction possibly targeting a lot of people, or a specific group of people. It targets humans and turns them into hosts of fire creatures. Grayscale or what causes the greyscale is invented to fight against this fever but is probably not effective or enough(Not sure about this one). The last of those people run to the north of what is now known as Westeros. The Heart of Winter is created or activated to fight back. Humans are turned into the ice creatures that are now known as the Others. A wall of ice is raised to protect the north from the fire monsters. Time passes. some of the wastelands are habitable again. The Heart of Winter is set to activate every many years as a measure of safety and humans have decided to contribute to the constant creation and the maintenance of the population of the Others. Now the fire is breaking again ( either by accident or someone is behind it. I do have a thought about that too) and it’s about to spread while no one is even remotely aware of it. This will be a surprise to all characters and readers. Others are coming to stop it at any cost while humans are oblivious. And so **winter is coming**.

0,1,0,2,0," Noble houses are one of the thematical foundations of Ice and Fire together with swords, dragons, and sorcery. They give the series the medieval flavor that many consider the book’s main popularity secret and misidentify the genre as ‘epic fantasy’. 

&gt;The medieval setting has been the traditional background for epic fantasy. \[From the wiki on ASoIaF.\]

It is not fantasy, in my opinion, not anywhere near it, but the houses do provide both historical background and the narrative for the book’s developments. Lineage of certain characters is the subject of many (most?) fan theories. IaF must have the world record for number of characters whose lineage is quite debatable. Many fan posts on /r/gameofthrones are dedicated to visual elements of Houses: sigils, banners, words, etc. Here is the first proposition of the post: *precisely because the houses matter so much in the narrative so far, there are no houses anymore in the end*. 

Thematically, Ice and Fire is about re-forging of the world. Its leitmotif is Gotterdamerung, the inevitable end of Westeros, which somehow is avoided, most likely undeservingly. The world doesn’t end, but is reshaped – physically and geographically, but most importantly: socially. Consider the book a GRRM’s attempt to dramatize the end of medieval world, to condense it to a few eventful years, instead of centuries. What social structure will emerge after the books is impossible to say, but noble Houses won’t survive the transformation as there are no nobles in the end. To think that George’s idea of proper ending is Jon/Dany/Whoever sitting on the Iron Throne and lesser folks cooking, cleaning, and serving for them – to think that is madness. 

The break down of the ‘notion of houses’ can be observed even now. Jaime, Tyrion, and, to an extent, Cersei spend significant time considering: What is House Lannister? Does it even exist? Should it? Does it deserve to? Who is a Lannister? Is Tyrion a Lannister? Is he happy about it? In the North, one of major Season 7 developments is the same question: What is a House? Who represents House Umber or House Kastark? If there is such thing as House Kastark, then shouldn’t the House Kastark be punished for actions of House Kastark? Previously, we saw Boltons, Roose and Ramsey. There was Roose and there was Ramsey, but their story line is realization that there is no House Bolton. They are not following the same goals, principles, and methods. In the end Sansa tells Ramsey:

&gt;Your house will die.

One implication of ‘no houses’ is the futility of asking fan-favorite questions: Which House will claim the Iron Throne? Which House will control place X? There is no Iron Throne in the end. Asking which house will control High Garden, for instance, is equally pointless: There are no more houses. Half of the places will no longer exist geographically. Think about Daenerys detonating the uranium of Westeros, the obsidian, the atomic bomb, the tsunami that follows. As a possibility, of course: I can’t 100% identify the nature of the coming disaster, but disaster it is going to be. All that talk of places under the sea is not so much because there are palaces hidden under the current seas, but a hint at the current castles, towers, and palaces submerging under the rising seas. Instead of us coming to the sea, the sea will come to us.

What goals do houses generally pursue? Why, you would ask, the obvious goals: power, prestige, lands, influence, etc. In other words: houses want to win. Or, at least, survive. Martin, however, wouldn’t be himself if all the houses in his book pursue only self-interests. Heroes go against self-interests, obvious goals, or even survival. The whole point of having so many houses and writing hundreds of pages of history is to lead us to a character whose motivation is *ending his or her own house.* We see elements of that in Tyrion. In Jaime, too. He doesn’t accept doing things because a Lannister must do this or that. He joins the Kingsguard, which is pretty much the end of House Lannister – as Tywin fears. Tywin doesn’t consider Cersei as future of his house – she is a woman. And he certainly doesn’t want Tyrion. Throughout the books, Jaime refuses to do things a Lannister should do. Jaime has all the traits of a hero in the sense of Nietzsche – acting on his own volition, exercising the ultimate freedom. 

But our ultimate hero goes against his own house and fulfills Martin’s old dream of writing a book where the hero dies at the onset. Rhaegar is such a hero. Rhaegar’s primary motivation, I suspect, is that *House Targaryens must end.* Think about *Jedi must end* of Episode 8, however you feel about it. The phrase and the theme, Jedi must end, is genuine, I believe, Abrams’ approved. Think where the Star Wars authors got the idea and I would say: from seeing the deeper meaning of the Ice and Fire. Understanding that all things must end. As Rhaegar realizes, with sadness, about his own house. 

There is no shortage of explanations of how Rhaegar allowed Robert’s Rebellion to occur. On YouTube you would find plenty of videos. Some suggest Betrayal, Incompetence, and Bad Luck. On the same topic: Why Rhaegar or Lyanna didn’t say anything? Why did they let the idea of ‘abduction’ take root? Because Rhaegar *wanted it* to be perceived exactly as it was perceived. Here is the list from my older post (see [https://fractal-affinity.com/got/c18/RhaegarTheDeceiver.html](https://fractal-affinity.com/got/c18/RhaegarTheDeceiver.html) ) with some minor modifications:

* · Rhaegar did have influence, if only through Varys. He could have prevented appointment of young and unexperienced Jon Connington. He didn’t. And Connington failed to stop the rebellion – precisely as Rhaegar hoped for. 
* · Lyanna’s abduction is the best way to alienate several powerful houses with one action: it provokes Starks and Baratheons. And their allies. Rhaegar didn’t want to clarify the situation, because he needed the Rebellion. I liked the theory that Littlefinger intercepted some messages clarifying the situation or lied somehow – not because there are evidences to support the theory, but simply because I liked it. If true, then still, in my opinion, the messages would have come from Lyanna, it was her who wanted to explain herself to her family – not Rhaegar. 
* · Leaving Jaime with his father. Jaime’s PoV emphasizes that it was Rhaegar’s decision. 
* · Leaving best Kingsguard with Lyanna instead of taking them with him. The point of having them at the Tower of Joy? The whole point is *not* having them where they would have made a difference, at the Trident. Having Ser Arthur Dayne with him at the Trident would mean dead Robert – as Eddard’s PoV clearly states. And that’s why Rhaegar didn’t take Ser Arthur with him.
* · Not sending Rhaella and his children to Dragonstone, away from King’s Landing. Some would argue that Aerys wanted them as hostages, because he didn’t trust Rhaegar. I’d say that is exactly the reason why Rhaegar would have at least tried to get them out of King’s Landing – if he had their survival in mind. He didn’t. 
* · Ask yourself how is the brightest prince in Westeros, a history expert knowing everything about politics and people’s behavior, the one who even had visions of the future – how Rhaegar didn’t anticipate the obvious consequences? My answer: he did. 

Rhaegar’s situation is quite different than Tyrion’s or Jaime’s. Both ‘go against their own house’. However, for Lannisters it is mostly the vagueness of their identity: who is a Lannister? What do we even have in common? (Tywin, Jaime, Tyrion, Cersei?) Individuals, personal identities, dominate over the rather abstract notion of ‘our house’ for Lannisters. In case of Rhaegar, there is no question of ‘house uncertainty’: everybody, especially Rhaegar himself, knows what House Targaryen is. Fire and blood. Let me recall the main themes I see in House Targaryen:

* · Supermen, overmen, Nietzsche. They are better than men. It is not hubris, it is not boasting. It is simply a fact. ‘Fire and Blood’, the new book, hints at it several times. 
* · As always in Ice and Fire, there is a catch. Targaryens’ super power is also their curse. The purity of genes that allowed transfer of their skills through generations comes with other traits; they can’t edit genes, they can only preserve them. One of those is the tendency to fall in love with their own kind. What ‘Fire and Blood’ makes even clearer is that Targaryens marry each other not because it is their tradition or some custom they choose to follow. There is no choice for many of them. They are doomed to fall for each other (often – not always, of course). Think about Jaeherys and his sister – it just happened with them: nobody told them they had to do it, in fact everybody at that time would have told them not to. Their mother wasn’t a Targaryen. They certainly didn’t learn it from their mother. And their father was dead by that time. But it was in their blood. Same with Daenerys and Jon in Season 7: they come to each other as almost hypnotized, as if some force they can’t resist was controlling them. 
* · Destruction. Targaryens are war machines – even if they don’t want to be war machines. This is how I see the story of Rhaenys Targaryen (more on it in a separate post). It doesn’t matter what disadvantage Daenerys incurs due to following somebody else’s advices. Sooner or later, her super-general genes will turn themselves on and she will win – almost against her own will. Targaryen skills come with genes that also override their motivations: she will become destruction incarnate regardless of how her ‘old self’ would feel about it. 
* · Sadness. There is much sadness Targaryens endured due to jealousy, misplaced feelings, and their frequent inability to love ‘normal’ people. 

How does all of it relate to Rhaegar? What I find significant is that ‘Fire and Blood’ is written as an actual book from the world. A book that somebody important has read. And that somebody was Rhaegar. How would Rhaegar feel reading about his history? What summaries would he make? I argue that the most obvious summary of ‘Fire and Blood’ is that Targaryens are fire and blood. They bring death and destruction, including to their own in the Dance of Dragons. Ideas that Rhaegar wanted rebirth of dragons – I doubt it. Rather, remember how Aegon the Younger reacted to dragons. Not only that – you can say ‘bringers of destruction’ about other events or houses – but *Targaryens can not escape doing it.* Fire is in their blood. They may or may not have dragons, but they will have their aggression and domination. The second observation Rhaegar would make is how Targaryens’ feelings and reactions are amplified over normal people. Targaryens react more acutely. And that is all from the first part of the book – long before Summerhall, the tragedy that was always on Rhaegar’s mind. 

What did Rhaegar conclude? Simple: the continuing existence of House Targaryen will bring tremendous suffering to the world, including Targaryens themselves. Their desire for power will always be with them. Their appetite for destruction will always be with them. Their attempts to bring back dragons will not stop. We should never forget that the Mad King is Rhaegar’s father – and what it means for Rhaegar. How did Rhaegar feel? When the Mad King was torturing people, how did Rhaegar feel? When after torturing the Mad King was seeking sexual satisfaction in violently raping Rhaegar’s mother, how did he feel? Those stories about the Mad King are planted in the books for a reason, inviting us, the readers, to ask: what was Rhaegar to do? *Rhaegar came to a conclusion that House Targaryen must be removed from power.* And being a Targaryen, certain to succeed in whatever they set their minds on, he was quite successful in it. 

This motivation, to die and not to win, may seem strange. It certainly seems unusual. But it is not unique in the books and the sources that, in my view, inspired the books. I wrote about the influences from ‘Lost Generation’ literature. The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot begins with the following epigraph:

I saw with my own eyes the Sibyl at Cumae hanging in a cage, and when the boys said to her: “Sibyl, what do you want?” she answered: “I want to die.”

One of the major ‘organized groups’ in the books is the Faceless Men. Their motivation is to bring death as a gift. Another group is the maesters. While it would be inaccurate to ascribe massive assassination plots to maesters, there are theories implicating maesters in death of dragons and, perhaps, planning to end Targaryens as sorcerers they can neither understand nor control. Many Houses of Westeros praise noble death. Many characters in the books choose death. In case of Rhaegar, GRRM takes it to a different level when the hero choose not only his death, but death of his dynasty. 

One of the motivations for writing the post was my ongoing bewilderment on how many YouTubers ascribe to Rhaegar plans to ‘win the throne’. To overthrow the Mad King. I can’t understand how Rhaegar’s obvious revulsion towards power and domination could have gone unnoticed. Think about Rhaegar and ask yourself: Does he look like one who craves power? He does not. When I discussed Rhaegar’s plans for the Tourney at Harrenhal, some posters believed that I was pointing out quite obvious and universally accepted facts. Specifically, that The World of Ice and Fire does its usual misleading: it provides three opinions, two are true, and one is false. There was indeed something mysterious about plans for the tourney, it was Rhaegar who organized it behind the scenes – those are the two truths. That he did it planning to overthrow his father – that was a lie. What I don’t quite understand is how fans overlook the direct implication of that: If he wasn’t setting up a coup, then what? My thinking is that he was planning to achieve exactly what he did: to win the tournament and crown Lyanna. But that also means that he was a) rationally planning it – hence it wasn’t about sudden passion and love; b) dishonest with Lyanna – using her as a sure way to provoke realm into rebellion, most likely without her understanding what is happening. 

Rhaegar wanted to end Targaryens. Some details of that would certainly have to wait till we know more. Did he want to end their rule, but not their bloodline? Did he want to end their genes by choosing a counter, a Northener, and that is why he chose Lyanna? To neutralize the ‘evil’ part of their genome? Did he choose Lyanna to strengthen the ‘mind control’ abilities of Jon, rather than to weaken Targaryen genetic traits? It seems strange that Rhaegar, with all his visions and prophecy knowledge, wouldn’t foresee that it was Daenerys who gives birth to dragons. Certainly, a boy couldn’t give birth, hence his son with Lyanna couldn’t give birth, then why give him dragon-riding-warging genetic abilities when there are no dragons? 

TLDR: The story is largely about houses, and that’s why in the finale there are no more houses, they don’t matter. People become just people, not banner carriers. Houses already lose their cohesion, they cease to exist in logical, unified sense. Some houses play the game of thrones to die and not to win, on purpose. Example: Rhaegar Targaryen. The purpose of ‘Fire and Blood’ book is to show that Targaryens always win. The purpose of Ice and Fire books is to show that they do – unfortunately for them and the world and that’s why Rhaegar was planning to end them. No Targaryen survives the books (otherwise there is no true ending as readers would earn for ‘stories of the next generation of Skywalkers/Targaryens’).

0,1,0,13,17,"CCXP: Arya Stark’s final season of Game of Thrones will be reminiscent of her Season 1 story arc[.](https://i.imgur.com/qh23ss8.jpg)

&gt;**Question:** What is the main theme of Arya and Sam’s journey towards the end of the show?

&gt;**Maisie Williams**: In my case, Arya has a development that has a lot of reminiscence to the beginning of the show. In fact, after reading the script, I went to my house and watched the entire first season. I needed to see the beginning of each arc and each decision that Arya was taking, because the big difference with the other seasons, is that there will be no loose ends.

In this CCXP interview, Maisie gave special attention to the beginning of each arc in her S1 story (noting different points of progression) and the decisions Arya ultimately makes.

For starters…

Arya begins S8 as the fighter she always wanted to be. So what elements in her S8 story arc creates that pressure on Arya to go against who she wants to be like it did in S1? Recall her line in S7, **“The world doesn’t just let girls choose who we want to be.”**

Arya’s strong bond with Jon. Descisions from all the way back in Winterfell when she broke the rules and kept Jon’s gift to her in Needle (without her parent’s permission) and later denies her father the truth when he asks her who gave her the sword. Arya would not betray Jon, not even for her father.

S1 doesn't have her Kill List/No One/FM storyline. S8 is Arya through and through. Which tags nicely with **Maisie’s recent comment about S8: seeing a lighter more fun Arya that we knew at the beginning of the series.**

Maisie also made it very clear that she got to do everything she wanted for Arya in S8 which makes what she has said (in an interview after reading the S8 scripts) of what she wants for Arya very enlightening:

&gt;**Question**: Do you have ideas about how you’d like Arya’s journey to end?

&gt;**Maisie**: I’ve always said I wanted her to find peace. The things that have been driving her through her story have been very bitter and twisted and aggressive. I would love for Arya to find her true self again and let go of this anger and revenge that’s accompanied her on this journey. I’d love for her to be happy.

At the end of S1, Arya witnesses a family member die. In her own futile way, she tries to save them but is powerless to stop it from happening.

Arya is forcibly turned into Arry the orphan boy at the end of S1. Her hair shredded and cut off by Yoren while she cries and tries to stop him. Perhaps we may see something similar happen again? Remember she is a fighter and the warrior going into S8 but maybe that will not be her final state by the end of the season? Something pushing her to change who she wants to be. Bittersweet.

Maisie also revealed that Arya has goals in S8 that she has never had before. 🤔

&gt;The actors were forbidden in the interview to talk about the series’ eighth season, but Maisie also gave clues to Arya’s future. “Back to Winterfell was amazing, it was her focus throughout the show,” she says. **“In this new season she has completely different goals, which she has never had before,”** she says.

The incident at the Trident. Choosing to protect an innocent smallfolk boy when attacked by someone highborn and royal. That descision has major consequences, she has to let Nymeria go and Lady dies in her place.

To become Arry, accepting this new identity that was forced upon her as her way to survive and make it back home.

Also, Maisie said right at the end of her recent series recap interview, that after LF’s death scene **""they make a conscious decision to see a change in Arya.""**  👀 It seems these changes will continue into S8.",1,(Spoilers Extended) Hints &amp; Predictions for Arya's S8 plotline,3690,66

0,1,0,29,4,"It baffles me that Game of Thrones didn’t include Lady Stoneheart. It would have been an internet-breaking moment. The TV-viewing audience who haven’t read the books would have gone apeshit over it. The reveal that Catelyn Stark has been brought back from the dead seems like too good a moment to pass up. I just can’t for the life of me figure out why they didn’t do it.

At first I thought maybe she doesn’t play much a role later in the books, or the Brotherhood doesn’t (they had been pretty much absent from the show since season 3). But then the Brotherhood randomly pops back up in season 6. I also can’t imagine Cat not having much a role in the books. She’s got Brienne bringing Jaime to her. Two major characters maybe facing their deaths. Even if neither die and they end up killing her or something, that still seems like such a good moment for them not to include. Imagine Cat coming back to life and then Brienne or Jaime killing her. How could the TV-viewing audience not love that?

There’s even theories she will orchestrate a Red Wedding 2.0 and kill all the Freys at Devan Lannister’s wedding. How is that not something the show would want to include? I guess they wanted Arya to kill all the Freys. That was kind of a cool moment, but the Red Wedding 2.0 seems like a much better scene. The Red Wedding was such a huge TV moment. If George is going the way of a reverse Red Wedding where the BWB kill a bunch of Freys and Lannisters, that seems like that too would have made for a huge TV moment.

Maybe they just didn’t want to bring Michelle Fairley back only to put her in tonnes of makeup and prosthetics and give her no dialogue. Alex Graves talked about that. I really don’t get that either. An actor doesn’t need dialogue to give a compelling performance and it might even be an interesting challenge an actor would like to take on. Alex Graves described her as a “zombie” but I think that’s a poor interpretation of the character. She is Catelyn Stark, but death has changed her and she’s hellbent on vengeance. She looks like a zombie because her body was left underwater for so long. But she’s not a stereotypical mindless zombie. She’s a legit character with motives.

I am in no way implying that I actually believe this, but I do consider it plausible, at least in the show. This is contingent upon events that have not yet occurred in the books, and I'm not going to comment on the likelihood that the books go in the same direction. TL;DR at the end in bold.

Let's start with what we know, at least in the show:

1. The wights and Others are weak to fire, dragonglass, and Valyrian steel.

2. Dragonglass is a volcanic glass (obsidian), and Valyrian steel is likewise associated with fire.

3. One of the main advantages to using Valyrian steel in combat is that an equivalent blade shape is lighter if made with it.

4. Flying vertebrates tend to have lighter bones than flightless ones.

5. Valyrian steel production ended after the Doom of Valyria, which also killed most of Valyria's dragons and made their corpses unrecoverable.

6. Dragons are ""fire made flesh,"" and their bones have similar physical properties to iron.

7. Knowledge about working Valyrian steel still exists, implying that its creation is a supply issue.

8. Sam probably has a recipe for Valyrian steel in his possession.

9. Viserion is a wight.

From 1 and 2, we can expect that Valyrian steel is effective against wights and Others for the same reason fire is. From 3, 4, 5, and 6, we can infer that the ""secret ingredient"" is dragon bone. From 7, 8, and 9, we can perhaps predict that new Valyrian steel is going to be created now that we (probably) have a recipe and a dead dragon.

All that we need is for zombie Viserion to die and stay dead. This would be necessary anyways to prevail against the Others, and Dany still has two fire-breathing dragons. Viserion is now weak to fire; take him down and use his bones.

**TL;DR Drogon kills zombie Viserion for good, and his bones are used to create the first new Valyrian steel in centuries.**

Apparent problems:

1. Killing Viserion means that the ""good guys"" are probably already holding their own against the Others.

2. Valyrian steel may also require blood sacrifice, in which case either someone is Nissa Nissa in a literal echo of the prophecy or this isn't happening at all.

3. They already have a dragonglass mine. While it would be better to arm the many accomplished swordsmen we have with steel, they could probably get away with using dragonglass if they had to.

4. Blowing up the Sept of Baelor in the show doesn't mean that all of the wildfire under King's Landing is gone, and none of it has been used in the books. Perhaps, as has been postulated before, the Mad King yelling ""burn them all"" was about the Others, and that's what they do instead - no Valyrian steel required.

EDIT: You're right - forgot all about the bones in the dungeons in King's Landing. This leads me to conclude that either knowledge is rare enough that no one thought to use them or the recipe also includes blood sacrifice.",1,(Spoilers Extended) Extreme tinfoil ahead; on Valyrian steel production and why it might be resumed.,3007,100

I have watched the entire show (3 times) and have watched enough Youtube theories, histories, lore etc that I believe I am making at least a slightly informed theory.

I thought this up after watching “In Deep Geek”, the episode on Varys.  Varys has always struck me weird.  

Vary’s seems extremely concerned about “The Realm”.  While one could be forgiven for thinking that Vary’s is a sneaky bastard (which he sort of is), via the bit of books I have read and the show I get the sense that this is a genuine concern for Varys.  He is obviously capable of playing “the game” and can lie and cheat, watch people like Ned die for no real reason, etc etc.  On the surface it looks as though it might be to hold onto power.  But I think all that is driven by a long vision and wish for peace in the kingdom.

Ok that parts said.  Now why is that weird?  He’s simply a man who has been through the ringer and has learned a greater sense of empathy.  Eh….maybe but I believe it may be much much deeper than that.  

Let’s go back to something that Maester Aemon said to John:

“What is honor compared to a woman's love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms... or the memory of a brothers smile? Wind and words. Wind and words. We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love. That is our great glory, and our great tragedy.”- A Game of Thrones

This seem innocuous as maybe Aemon got laid at one point.  But what’s the deal with the baby part?  I’ve seen questions about Aemon having a kid but they are fairly quickly brushed aside.  But should they be?  

Aemon being the second son of Maekar I, joined the Maesters order.  We know this much.  We know that Aerion died and that Aegon V became king.  We know that Aemon was ok with this as he turned down the throne.  But what if, much like Samwell Tarly, Aemon knew the love of a woman….and sorta like Samwell he know the feel of an “actual newborn” son in his arms?  Then things become more interesting.  

I’m not sure about the timeline here but I’m assuming Varys is about 50 something years old.  Late 40’s at best.  That could easily line up with the current timeline (I believe...don’t quote me).  What if Maester Aemon had a child during the reign of Aegon V?  Or maybe super early in  Jaehaerys’ reign?  That’s a possibility.  

So just say that happened?  Why the hell did Varys end up in the Free Cities getting his balls cut off by some weird dude from the circus?  Perhaps because Maesters didn’t have kids on the regular?  Perhaps his baby momma ran off?  Perhaps because either Aegon V or Jaehaery’s felt threatened in their own children’s line of succession if they’re Uncle were or great Uncle (I’m getting confused here) were still alive?  Any number of reasons he ended up alone with a group of actors who then sold him.  

Perhaps he has such a concern for the realm because he watched as everything his family had built was being destroyed.  By Aegon at first, then Robert Baratheon then by the Lannisters.  Why did Vary’s conspire with Illyrio from Pentos to get Daenerys onto the throne?  Or at least back into Westeros?  Why did Vary’s offer friendship so easily to Tyrion?  I’m assuming that Tyrion is actually a Targaryen as many theories and common logic would dictate.  

BUT BUT what about when Varys sent the assassins after Daenerys?  That’s a valid question except that perhaps he simply relayed the message, not thinking it would actually be carried out because she was with Khal Drogo at that point?  He figured she’d be safe and the assassins would die.  It’s a possibility.

The story about him becoming an eunuch could be real.  Perhaps his mother left Aegon after she learned he turned down the throne because she was a gold digger from the jump?  Then she just left that kid who was no useless to her somewhere in the Free Cities?  Perhaps Aegon send them away because they were running from something.  He goes to the wall, she goes to the free cities and everyone forgets about them.  Mom gets killed and Varys ends up alone on the streets.  Seems reasonable. 

Perhaps the voice in the flames was telling Varys who he really was?  Perhaps the anticipated betrayal by Varys is Dany realizing he may have claim to her throne and she starts going a little crazy like her Dad.  Perhaps the death of Varys will lead into Lightbringer being plunged into her heart due to her guilt.  I’m reaching I know but stranger things have happened in this show &amp; literature.  

One other point.  While Vary’s doesn’t ever get close to the dragons, he doesn’t seem to be horribly afraid of them.  Even when Daenerys threatens to burn him alive he doesn’t seem to flinch at all, as though he knows that fire can’t hurt him.  Just another observation.  

So not sure if the timeline matches up but I think Varys is going to jump on one of those dragons and save the day in season 8.  I could be wrong but it was fun thinking this up.  For all we know there’s hidden Targaryens all of the damn place.

""Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai, was chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over. The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered. The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew before hand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, [Nissa Nissa](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Nissa_Nissa), and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her breast, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, while her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon."" -Salladhor Saan Davos - I ACoK

The inital mistake that I think we as readers have done is to assume that the sword means a literal sword. Although Alt+Shift+X did a wonderful video on who Azor Ahai is and why Lightbringer could be a dragon as characters in the books often compare the dragons to swords of fire.

   
 

**All Summed up, it basically says**: 

Daenerys in the Womb of the World lake = Tempering in water

Covered in Hrakkar Skin = Tempering in the heart of a captured lion

Killing of Drogo = Nyssa Nyssa sacrifice.

   
 

Note that since only death pays for life, and Daenerys paid for Rhaegal and Drogon's lives by unintentionally killing Drogo and Rhaego, two unwilling sacrifices. The willing sacrifice of Mirri Maz dur is what birthed Viserion. And as punishment apylt goes around in Asoiaf, Viserion is killed by the Night King and thus will not help the fight against the white walkers in bringing back the dawn. Thus they're the metaphorical Lightbringer ""sword"". 

I believe that Drogo was indeed the Nissa Nissa that Daenerys killed and sacrificed. The cut on Drogos chest which Daenerys worsened by making Mirri Maz Dur tend to, who planned on killing Drogo via the wound was the unwilling sacrifice she made. I know that it still was an unwilling sacrifice but i believe that her dreams did convince her that killing Drogo could help her dragons birth. 

I believe that lightbringer was supposed to be Dany's son Rhaego but now refers to Rhaegal and Drogon. Since he was caled like a lizard, I believe daenerys could have by mistake tried to birth an actual dragon-human hybrid. 

""Monstrous,"" Mirri Maz Duur finished for him. The knight was a powerful man, yet Dany understood in that moment that the maegi was stronger, and crueler, and infinitely more dangerous. ""Twisted. I drew him forth myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with the stub of a tail and small leather wings like the wings of a bat. When I touched him, the flesh sloughed off the bone, and inside he was full of graveworms and the stink of corruption. He had been dead for years."" 

**The Tempering in Water:**

In order to temper the sword the first time, Azor Ahai tempers the sword in water and it breaks. This i think refers to Dany taking bath in the Womb of the world. 

From the wiki of Ice and Fire:

Eventually they arrive at the lake called the [Womb of the World](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Womb_of_the_World). Here Daenerys strips out of her soiled clothing and enters the lake. She cleanses her face and body of the dried blood. When she emerges from the lake, [Doreah](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doreah) brings her a robe of sandsilk, but Drogo waves her away. Daenerys can see his manhood through his trousers and helps him unlace; with three quick strokes, he is done. 

I believe that she ""tempered"" Rhaego by entering the lake. 

   
 

**Tempering in the the heart of a lion:**

From the wiki of Ice and Fire:

Drogo returns with the carcass of a *hrakkar* as the stars come out. After he has told her that he will make her a cloak of its skin.

***Hrakkar*** are a breed of white [lion](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lion) native to the [Dothraki sea](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dothraki_sea).[\[1\]](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hrakkar#cite_note-Ragot54.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-1) 

   
 

Daenerys ""tempers"" Rhaego by covering herself in the lion pelt. Note that this is just after she puts the Dragon eggs on the brazier.

   
 

**Tempering by showing it into the breast of Nyssa Nyssa:**

From the wiki of Ice and Fire:

Daenerys finds Drogo with an arrow through his arm and an [*arakh*](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Arakh) cut that has taken off one of his nipples. Drogo insists that they are only scratches and boasts that he personally slew not only Khal Ogo, but also his son [Fogo](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Fogo), who was *khal* after Ogo. Daenerys praises her husband. 

When Drogo reaches out to Daenerys, he winces and Daenerys cries for the healers. She is told that Drogo sent the healers away to tend the more grievously wounded. [Mirri Maz Duur](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mirri_Maz_Duur), a Lhazareen woman Daenerys rescued, speaks up, saying she can help. [Aggo](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aggo) is about to cut her throat when Daenerys demands that the woman, who wears the remains of fine clothing, be allowed to speak. Mirri Maz Duur explains that she is a healer and [godswife](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Godswife). Drogo’s [bloodriders](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bloodrider) mistrust her, naming her a healer of sheep and a [*maegi*](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maegi). 

The godswife states that he is beyond help and will be gone by morning. Daenerys pleads with her, insisting that there must be a way, a magical way. Mirri Maz Duur admits she does know some dark magic learned at great cost from a bloodmage from the [Shadow Lands](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Shadow_Lands); it will cost a life. Daenerys asks if it means her life, but Mirri Maz Duur assures her it does not. 

We later find out that MMZ actually wanted to kill Drogo by letting his wound fester. She unwillingly sacrificed Drogo.

I leave you'll with this GRRM quote on prophecies. Let me know what youll think!

Prophecy is one of those tropes of Fantasy that is fun to play with, but it can easily turn into a straightjacket if you're not careful. One of the themes of my fiction, since the very beginning, is that the characters must make their choices, for good or ill. And making choices is hard. There are prophecies in my Seven Kingdoms, but their meanings are often murky and misleading, and they seldom offer the characters much in the way of useful guidance.

GRRM [has also said](http://www.adriasnews.com/2012/10/george-r-r-martin-interview.html) that he likes prophecies to be fulfilled in completely unpredictable and unexpected ways:

Prophecies are, you know, a double edge sword. You have to handle them very carefully; I mean, they can add depth and interest to a book, but you don’t want to be too literal or too easy... In the Wars of the Roses, that you mentioned, there was one Lord who had been prophesied he would die beneath the walls of a certain castle and he was superstitious at that sort of walls, so he never came anyway near that castle. He stayed thousands of leagues away from that particular castle because of the prophecy. However, he was killed in the first battle of St. Paul de Vence and when they found him dead he was outside of an inn whose sign was the picture of that castle! \[Laughs\] So you know? That’s the way prophecies come true in unexpected ways. The more you try to avoid them, the more you are making them true, and I make a little fun with that.

If he missed the feast, was injured in the fall, or stormed out in rage he wouldn’t do what they all knew he was going to do.

But just in case, Mellisandre took an antidote before hand, so that if Cressen persisted in his folly she would be safe.

I could be wrong about the efforts to subtly foil his plan, but I definitely think beyond a doubt that they knew ahead of time what he was planning and Mellisandre took an antidote. He left the poison unattended on his desk, which is just stupidly foolish.

0,1,0,10,1,After reading several northern rebuild fics based on asoiaf/GoT which all include the establishment of a port town at Sea Dragon Pointon to serve as the main western port of the north. From what maps I've seen of the north the area northeast of the stony shore and southwest of the wolfwoods would be preferable to sea dragon point as a port city as it has potentially good transport links with the ryswell and tallhart lands. Also most of the area is flat and I would assume is possibly fertile meaning that it could feed a potential city. Whereas Sea Dragon point's transport links to the bulk of the north aren't really that good as it requires whoever wants to go to the rest of the north to travel through the wolfswood. As a the major trading port on the west coast wouldn't that be detrimental. The only advantage that I can see about sea dragon point over the other area is that sea dragon point has large amounts of lumber suitable for ship building. But then that also means that the land is unlikely to be able to support a large population. From what I can tell it has been chosen by the virtue that its actually mentioned in the books by Asha Greyjoy when she has taken sea dragon point and later more than most other places on the western coast.

Instead the girl turns up on Slaver's Bay and leaves a string of burning cities in her wake, and the fat man decides we should meet her by Volantis. Now that plan is in ruins as well.

One tradition in particular that strikes me as plausible is the Dothraki tradition of burning their dead. Yes, many cultures do it. It's a very easy way to ritualize a death and dispose of a body, but the reasons why the Dothraki do it are more than that. They claim that if the body doesn't burn, then the deceased will not be able to ride in the night lands with his ancestors.

Should you not burn someone during the Long Night and they be enslaved by The Others magic, then they would become a reanimated corpse. That would be clear evidence they aren't resting peacefully with their ancestors...they would be rising and violent towards their surviving relatives.

A few days have gone by and I wanted to share a few more thoughts on Jon Snow as a Lincoln-like character.

* **Slavery:**  The Others and the Valyrians both have a history of slavery.  Whether it be turning men into undead soldiers or forcing them to work in hellish mines, these magical races present mankind with a supernatural threat of slavery extending into the afterlife.  During the Civil War, there was real fear that a Southern victory would mark the expansion of slavery throughout the country and possibly the world.  If Jon is the hero I think he is, he will stand against this supernatural threat of slavery to the benefit of mankind
* **Prophetic Dreams:**  A small detail but nonetheless I think it is exceptionally Targaryen;  Abraham Lincoln was well known for sharing peculiar dreams with friends, family or anyone who would listen.  He reported these dreams to people before almost every major battle.  There was even an account that he had one of his unique dreams the night preceding his assassination.
* **Fantastic Resurrection:**  The death of Lincoln was extremely disturbing for the country and especially for those that knew him personally.  There is a incredible quote from his Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, immediately following Lincoln's death on the morning of April 15th 1865;  *""There lies the most perfect ruler of men the world has ever seen. Now he belongs to the ages.""*  Lincoln carried the North to victory and he died in the Spring of 1865 after a war of horrific proportions.  I think it is very telling that he survived through the entire ""long"" night after he had been shot in the back of the head.  I personally believe that Jon Snow is coming back from the dead and I even think it is likely he will perish in the Spring when the War for the Dawn is ended.  I just think it would be a beautiful statement for George to bring Lincoln back from the dead in his fantasy story and I am a huge fan of the anti-slavery sentiments running through Dany's arc.
* **Teller of Stories:**  Abraham Lincoln was a legendary storyteller.  He recognized the value of stories for both imparting wisdom and for remembering wisdom.  I find it inspiring that Lincoln not only read every book he could get his hands on but he shared his stories with anyone who would listen.   Whether it be for humor or to emphasize a moral theme, Lincoln told stories with a purpose.  I believe George probably has a lot of respect for this kind of philosophy (I know I do).  There is only one glaring difference I noticed between the characteristics of Jon Snow and Abe Lincoln;  Jon Snow doesn't really read or share stories with the same voracity.  I think this difference can be explained away by the assumption that Jon Snow is the Song of Ice and Fire and that his character is at the center of the story George wants to tell.
* **Team of Rivals:**  Just for fun I wanted to point out one other characteristic that made Lincoln an effective leader.  I think this quality could have implications for Jon Snow becoming the sole commander in the the War for the Dawn.  Abraham Lincoln was extremely specific in the selection of his administration's cabinet.  He assembled his team based on their abilities and their support throughout the country.  He knew that he needed the right people if he was going to win the war regardless of how they felt about him.  He always remained magnanimous and gracious throughout his entire presidency because it worked.  He kept the team together and they grew to love him.  I think it has become quite clear that Planetos will need everyone they've got to survive the Long Night.  I can't wait to see if Jon Snow puts together his very own A-team from the best of the living.  He certainly has plenty of reasons to hate his enemies in Westeros but he will have to keep them together for the win!

0,1,0,273,564,"**TLDR: Basically in the scene were Roose legitimates Ramsay, he exposed the fact that D&amp;D (helpfully) shrank the world of Westeros from the Book!Westeros size of South America, 6.8 million square miles, to roughly the size Scandanavia, the British Isles, Germany, France, and a bit of Spain, 900,000 square miles.**

**This fixes a lot of logistical issues that bug people about the series (though absolutely not all of them *cough* Gendry Raven) and does so regardless of whether Westeros has 40 million people like GRRM says, or 10 million like D&amp;D say**


[DOUBLE EDIT START: So for those just reading, I'm discussing how the show dramatically shrank Westeros, and made the practicalities of that universe so much easier. Bolton gives the dimensions of the North to Ramsay as he's legitimating him, exposing that the Show creators have shrank the continent and made story telling much easier. GRRM initially stated that Westeros was the size of South America, which would put the North at 1 or 2 per square mile, and 6 or 7 for the rest, and most of the travel that happened

However, I moderately messed up the calculations below. I missed a 0, which means they D&amp;D revised it to be more like a 7th of GRRM's South America sized Westeros (6.8 million square miles down to 900,000 square miles like Argentina, but not 90,000 square miles like Britain that I originally posted).**Byt it is still true that D&amp;D fixed GRRM's failures in making Westeros work on a pracical level by resizing the world** Although it turns out in their revisions D&amp;D managed to mostly help GRRM but not really help their own bad writing. Stuff such as the Jon Snow weight hunt Gendry raven still make no sense. However, lots of other things in season 7 and generally like the sack of highgarten, the attack on the Gold Road, and even Jon making it to Dragonstone in a reasonable amount of time make much more sense in this show universe than the 

While GRRM's population of 40 million was just too small for a South America sized Westeros 6.8 million square miles, it is perfect for a D&amp;D 900,000 square mile landmass stretching from Wall and Gift on the Finno-Russian Border border down Scandinavia, while drawing in Britain, Ireland, and Iceland, with running through Germany, the Low Countries, Austria, and Switzerland, through France, and stopping at Catalonia and Aragon. In fact, at the time of the War of the Roses, the population of that very region was 40 million. A perfect fit for GRRM and the countries he modeled the 7 kingdoms after.

Even better, **this size works for both GRRM's 40 million population OR D&amp;D's alternative 10 million population for the show. One derives a rough 10 million population from the North have 30,000 soldiers over the course of the show, 10% of the 300,000 westerosi soldiers in the field. 1 million is a perfectly satisfactory population for Scandanavia or the North, as is 9 million concentrated through those countries in the South. 

Not only that, but there weren't all that many major cities at that time between these various countries at the time of the War of the Roses . It gives context and makes sense of the fact that there are only 5 cities in all of Westeros, which made little sense when GRRM stated that Westeros was as large as Latin America. 

This is a move by D&amp;D that covers George nicely on a lot of things, but in no way helps their terrible writing when it requires a raven to get from finland to the equivelent of Ibiza basically for Dany to Rescue Jon. 

It does help when it comes to things like it taking a month and a half to get from Winterfell (stockholm) to King's Landing (Paris), which can be done about 50 miles a day by horse over 42 days. Other things like the Casterly Rock and Highgarten fakeout also become more possible, because the world is 7 times smaller than GRRM had written it, causing lots of consternation about how there should have been months of obvious walking when in fact it was the equivelent of attacking Aquitaine (Highgarten) in Southwest France while the enemy focused erronously on taking Normandy (Casterly Rock) in North France. However, it then also made sense that a force of cavalry (and a dragon) would be able to catch up to an Army in central France (the Reach), realizing their mistake. 

This is a hypothetical for fun as to how to break out the lands in a way that reflect the population of their respective regions.

&amp;nbsp;

**First 450k for the North** 

Is basically a recreation of the Scandanavian Danegeld Empire, with Iceland as Skagos and Britain merged Scandanavia like Pangea into the North (450k) including Denmark as the Neck, including subtracting 50k for the gift --- a wall streching along the Finnish border with Novgorod ~~ Russian Folk ~~ Free Folk. Novgorod in Russia can be where the Free Folk live with the Russian lands beyond being the unknown beyond of the land of Always winter. 

**Then for 450k for the South**
 
Riverlands (100k) Saxony, Friesland in Germany, and the Low Countries 
Vale (60k) Switzerland, Austria, and Bavaria in and along the alps for the Vale (70k) 
Crownlands (30k) Ill de France, the special French special administratve region for the King (Ill de France) and the port Pas di Calais 
Dorne (50k): The lands of the Catlans and Aragonese betweem Spain and Southern France for Dorne. (60k) 
Stormlands (40k): and its surrounding lands and the Baeleric Islands (Dragonstone) for the Stormlands (30k), and  Reach (140k): the lion's share of France from Aquitaine in the West, to Avignon in the East, to Avignon in the North, with even Baden in Germany
Ironborn (30k) Ireland: appropriately close to the Lannisters and the North 

DOUBLE EDIT END]

[EDIT: Maybe I should have laid out more specifically. Roose Bolton in Season 4 with Ramsay from the point of Moat Cailin declares 400 miles east, 300 miles west, and 700 miles North is the North. Shave off a little bit for the North's weird coast lines, add a bit pack for the Islands, and you've got 45,000 square miles. Assume the North is as large as the other kingdoms combined is 90,000 square miles. That's literally the size of Britain: 60,000 for England, and 30,000 for Scotland. :EDIT]

Out of curiosity, I did some digging on the differences between the show's Westeros compared to the book's Westeros after reading complaints about how people move around too quickly on the show, and seeing people throw their hands up about GRRM's bananas choices regarding geography and population in Westeros. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Sources:**

Sources for the below include Wikipedia for anything not show related, the scene where Bolton legitimizes Ramsay by Moat Cailin for geographic numbers, and a long list on the game of thrones subreddit for the army numbers (I got around the Lannister expansion of their armies by including the Crownlands troops in there, once you do that you can call the book and the show essentially the same army wise). Population numbers came from Tyrions conversation with Doran in Season 3, and Jon Snow in Season 7.

&amp;nbsp;

**Assumptions:**

Population was for argument assumed to strictly comport with army size, and the population and armies of the North were the baseline. Population numbers were derived form this. Bolton's claims about miles and directions were taken at face value.

&amp;nbsp;

**Book!Westeros:** 

Population: 40,000,000 --- (guestimate) 36,000,000 South, 4,000,000 North 

Soldiers: 290k (going with the Show estimate because they're roughly the same) 

Soldiers/Population: 7,250 per 1 million 

Geography: 6.88 million, 4.5 million Square Miles in the South, 2.33 Million Square Miles in the North (book says 

North is actually 1/3 and not 1/2 Westeros unlike in the show) 

Population Density: 5.8 per square mile Big City 

Population: Kings Landing 500k

&amp;nbsp;

**Show!Westeros:** 

Population: 9.8 million --- 1 million the North and 8.8 million in the South (roughly guessed by assuming a strict proportionality between population and army size) 

Soldiers: 290k (roughly guessed based on show information and minimal book info) 

Soldiers/Population: 30k per 1 million (same as War of the Roses England) 

Geography: 900k Square miles, 450k North and 450k South (North is double Scotland, South is 4/5 England) 

Population Density: 11 per square mile overall 

Big City population: Kings Landing 500k  (It's only swollen to 1 million since refugees started pouring in)

This shift in character, and the power this gives him is tremendous... I was just wondering if anyone read anything further into it.

Additionally, never anywhere (that I can recall) is it ever mentioned a Targaryen passing down knowledge about dragons, dragon riding or dragon hatching to their children.

Especially after the Jaeherys chapters where he clearly knew the importance of dragons(the only reason his family ascended and remained in power), you would think he would catalog all information so it can be passed down through the generations.  The only thing even close we get is Seton Barth’s book that is lost to history, and he isn’t even a Targaryen.

They seemingly don’t even piece together that dragons thrive and grow larger on Dragonstone, which should be very easy to see.  One glaring example is Jaeherys own dragon Vermithor.  Vermithor was younger than Dreamfyre but actually grew bigger because his time was spent on dragonstone. 

-Did they truly just not have the knowledge?

-Do you think their knowledge and passing on dragon related info is implied but not spelled out in the text?

That is, let's assume that Jon actually *has* a story in *Winds*. So what possible paths lie ahead for the man who was once the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?

First: he stays at the Wall. This is probably my least favorite option, honestly. There's a lot of debate here over whether dying and coming back to life releases someone from the Night's Watch, or whether a King's will can do the same. Honestly, it feels a bit like debating if Ol' Bobby B's Targaryen ancestor gives him a claim to the Iron Throne. It was Robert's hammer, not his blood, that made him King, and whether you think Jon deserved it the fact remains that he was *murdered by his own men*. There's no way he does anything other than throw up two middle fingers and tell the Night's Watch to fuck itself when he comes back.

Maybe Jon goes North to save the Wildlings at Hardhome? That feels like a death sentence, and it's probably a moot point by the time he returns.

So maybe he finds Stannis? After all, Stannis is widely believed to beat the Boltons, retake Winterfell, install Rickon Stark as Lord of Winterfell, and march South to deal with the Lannisters and (maybe)Targaryens. Maybe Jon does the same? I dunno. It feels like that ship sailed when Jon became Lord Commander of the Night's Watch instead. Why retread that path? Maybe it's just me, but I feel like it would undermine Jon's arc in ADWD if Jon basically went, ""Welp, I tried this whole Lord Commander shtick out. Didn't work. Yo Stannis, is that offer still on the table?"" Jon Snow has always been a man of action, a man with goals who struggles to achieve them, and there's no story there. Is there? It looks like Jon just becomes a side character without much agency until R+L=J breaks him, which is boring, in my opinion.

So... what does Jon do? This is where that silly title comes into play. I think the reason D&amp;D wrote season 6 the way they did was because there's too many storylines at play in just the North, and they have the rest of Westeros, Braavos, and Meereen to deal with. I mean, we have:

* Stannis beating the Boltons

* Davos ""rescuing"" Rickon

* Sansa maybe bringing the knights of the Vale North

* whatever adventures Jon gets up to

It makes sense for them to try and consolidate all those into one story, even if the end result wasn't what we all wanted. But for *The Winds of Winter*? There's no place for Jon Snow in the North and I have no idea what he is going to do. 

That being said, here's some baseless speculation and nonsense tinfoil I came up with for what Jon might do when he comes back.

I think he might have a dark turn.
[This person thinks he's coming back darker than ever](https://offmichaelsbookshelf.wordpress.com/2016/02/24/return-of-the-white-wolf-jon-is-coming-back/), and they paint a pretty grim picture of what Jon might be like. 

It makes sense - Jon and Daenerys go through very similar story arcs and [Daenerys may go very dark](https://meereeneseblot.wordpress.com/2013/10/06/untangling-the-meereenese-knot-part-v-hizdahr-and-peace-or-daario-and-war/) in *The Winds of Winter*, so it logically follows that Jon post-resurrection might do the same.  

But as to what he actually *does*?, that's where I hit a wall. Maybe Jon declares himself King on the Wall, like the Night's King did in the Age of Heroes. Maybe Jon, broken and frustrated by a betrayal over what he thought was protecting the realm, decides that the Others aren't his concern anymore. *Let the Watch fall if that's what they want*, he might say. Maybe Jon goes to war with his siblings like that dream of his might have implied:

&gt;The world dissolved into a red mist. Jon stabbed and slashed and cut. He hacked down Donal Noye and gutted Deaf Dick Follard. Qhorin Halfhand stumbled to his knees, trying in vain to staunch the flow of blood from his neck. ""I am the Lord of Winterfell,"" Jon screamed. It was Robb before him now, his hair wet with melting snow. Longclaw took his head off. 

&gt; - *A Dance With Dragons*  Jon XII

But does anyone really want that?  Any of that? I know I don't. I like the idea of the Starks sticking together while the Lannisters and Baratheons kill each other. So I don't even have any idea what a dark turn for Jon Snow would look like lmao. This is why I'm not GRRM. He'll probably come up with something gripping and brilliant, but I have no idea what. 

I'm curious for your thoughts, though. What does Jon do? Does he stay at the Wall? Join Stannis? Go Dark? Something else entirely?

0,1,0,50,35,"* I think Jon's credit from the Iron Bank for buying food throughout the winter will be a very important factor in the future. He cannot and will not simply walk away from the Night’s Watch as it happened in the show. As revealed in Fire &amp; Blood, we can expect a massive starvation and lawlessness throughout the north in the rest of the story, far worse than it happened during Cregan Stark’s reign. During such times, a lot of people will talk along the lines like “The Lord Commander has food up there. He promises to feed anyone who helps him. You do not even have to take the black.” In fact, Jon said more or less this same thing to Alys Karstark. This will surely help Jon assume a much greater leadership role in the future, even a de facto King in the North, despite he will still be the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch.

* Finally, this huge debt to the Iron Bank, for which Jon is responsible, will be influential in the politics of the Realm. We can expect that the Night’s Watch will be in no shape to repay these huge debts. If the Night’s Watch is disbanded at the end, all the better drama. The Iron Bank will surely make the argument that this debt belongs to the Iron Throne (even if it is wasted after the Mad Queen plot) and the whole Realm. They will probably push for a pretender who is willing to repay all the debts of the Iron Throne (including the expenses of Robert, Cersei etc.) plus the debts of the Night’s Watch. 

* The wishful and naïve scenario that Westeros will return to divided kingdoms at the end should really die out. That is not the reality of this world. How will these divided kingdoms pay the past debts to the Iron Bank? Since they won't be able to do that even if they want, do you think the Iron Bank is incapable of sending Faceless Men after all the Lords declaring independence and refusing to repay any debts to the Iron Bank? In addition to that, the rebuilding of Westeros will need a lot of new loans, which they can't get anywhere if they refuse to pay the past debts to the Iron Bank. No. In every scenario, the Iron Bank will have a huge sway in deciding the political resolution of Westeros. And their interests lie with a united kingdom ruled by a monarch able and willing to repay all these debts.

* The end is very clear with this perspective. The surviving Lords will gather at Harrenhal in a Great Council like assembly. The Iron Bank will make them an offer they can't refuse. Don't expect anything less from people who threatened Jaehaerys the Fucking Concilliator with wiping out his House. They will all agree to elect Jon as their king and he shall have a very painful tax policy.",1,(Spoilers Extended) Food for thought,2658,36

It's kind of strange that Rosalin, the 5th daughter of Lord Walder &amp; a beautiful woman, was not among the many, many female Freys offered in marriage to a King, but later, when Edmure, merely a Lord Paramount, was coerced into marrying a Frey she was the only woman offered to him.

We know that George likes to show parallels between the past and present and the only Frey wedding from the past that he's written about was the marriage of Lord Butterwell to Lord Walder's sister in ""The Mystery Knight"". The bride had been disgraced when she was caught having sex with a servant and the wedding was a used as a means to plot treason against the Crown. Considering how slim the chances are that Edmure got Rosalin pregnant after just one night with her I think she was already pregnant so Lord Walder took a page out of his father's playbook and used the Red Wedding as a pretext to get the Northern Army to gather at the Twins so he could slaughter them and as a bonus he gets rid of his unmarried pregnant daughter and secretly humiliates Edmure by 'giving him horns'.

Nothing about that cat is normal, so I got to thinking about that cat in relation to the Varamyr POV, which was pretty much an expose on telepathic movement of a consciousness/spirit into another being, especially at death.  Rhaenys by all accounts has the right genetics for warging/dragonriding (through her Blackwood blood from Aegon V's wife and possibly from Elia through Dornish Danaerys).  I am thinking that one of the reasons that cat may be so special is that a part of Rhaenys lives on inside it, just as Orell lives on inside the eagle and CotF live on inside the Ravens.

Clearly, the Others are a threat to humans (and possibly animals) north of the wall – Mance’s goal was to get his people south of the wall to flee from these beings. We have seen the Others instigate attacks on humans. But, they are not always attacking humans, such as when the Others followed Tormund’s large group of wildlings to and past the wall. Clearly, humans and animals are being reanimated, and these reanimated corpses may be controllable by the White Walkers – though this is not yet confirmed in the books.

Please keep any evidence from the HBO series out of this discussion – for now, I am only interested in pondering ASOIAF. I still believe that the HBO series and the novels can really diverge on this topic. Obviously, the Others in the HBO series are high-tailing it across the Wall as we speak.

0,1,0,87,53,"With upcoming book there are a couple of factions still fighting the War of the 5 Kings part 2: Blackfyre Boogaloo.  


You got fAegon in the Stormlands  
The boy king Tommen supported by Lannisters, Tyrells, Freys and Boltons  
Euron Greyjoy around the shield island  
Stannis Baratheon in the North  
Possibly Dany  


Here are my predictions for how the battle lines will be drawn.   
fAegon has the support of the Golden Company and parts of the Stormlands. I predict that Dorne will throw it weight behind fAegon and join their intact forces with fAegon. The sandy and salty Dornishmen will at least. The stony Dornishmen have a bad relationship with the Martells and with the Marsher lords so maybe they won't fully commit yet.  


Tommen has in theory many supporters but their forces are horribly overextended.   
The Lannisters have their remaining strength in the Westerlands, in Riverrun and the Crakehalls and Plumms support the Freys in Darry. Strongboar seems to like his relatives the Crakehall Freys.  
The Freys are in quite a bad spot. Many people predict a Frey civil war, the Freys are scattered in the Twins, Riverrun and Darry. The Riverlords also don't fully support them.  
People also predict a Vale invasion of the Riverlands. Many Vale lords have ties to various Frey factions, Sweetrobin has a claim on Riverrun and Petyr Baelish is the lord of Harrenhal. When Littlefinger told Sansa they would go north he might be lying and actually claim his rightful place as lord of the Riverlands.  
The Boltons also officially support Tommen but they are in quite a pickle. If Stannis wins the battle on ice he will probably conquer the north easily and Tommen will have no support in the North.  


Finally the most important supporters of Tommen: the Tyrells. The Tyrells are scattered throughout the realm.   
A portion followed Loras Tyrell to Dragonstone, Mace Tyrell is refusing to leave Kings Landing with most of the Tyrell forces, Randall Tarly controls his own bannermen, forces from the crownlands, forces from the Bay of Crabs and the remaining Stormlands forces that support Tommen. Randall Tarly currently holds Margaery Tyrell and her cousins before their trial by the faith. Mathis Rowan leads the remaining forces that siege Storms End. Garlan Tyrell is marching to reconquer the Shield Islands, the Redwyne fleet is probably going to fight Euron and Oldtown will be attacked by Ironborn soon.  


Euron Greyjoy has a massive fleet. He conquered the Shield Islands, prepares to attack Oldtown and finally get the Hightowers in on the conflict and has his brother Victarion send to Essos to do something.  


Stannis Baratheon has the support of part of the Stormlands host, lords of the Narrow sea, Florents, Mountain clansmen, house Mormont and Glover. However people predict that House Umber, Manderly, Hornwood, Dustin, Ryswell, Stout, Flint, Flint, Locke and Tallheart are willing to betray the Boltons and Freys and possibly switch side to either Stannis or his Stark puppet.  


If Dany invades Westeros she will have support of Dothraki, her old allies and maybe some Ironborn but not many people would support her.  
There is a final wild card Aurane Waters who still controls part of the royal fleet.  


  
In conclusion:  
1. Tommen the current king will have almost no support. The Redwyne fleet will be destroyed (maybe by Krakens), Rowans sieging army will be scattered, Tyrells will be busy fighting the Ironborn, Lannisters will be too busy fighting with and/or against Freys in the Riverlands, the Freys will be infighting and the Riverlords won't support them and the Boltons will be dead or too far away.  
2. Stannis might conquer the North and they might fully support him. But the White Walkers block him from going south to claim the throne. His Stormland and Florent forces are also not that impressive anymore  
3. Euron will probably destroy the Redwyne fleet and gain free raiding time. Plunder massive booty in the Reach. But will have no way to conquer more. Victarion also might betray him.  
4. If Dany invades she will be seen as a barbarian queen. She only has the Unsullied and Dothraki rapist pillagers. She might ally to the Ironborn but that will make her look even worse. Though people have theorized that Dany will become a villain so it is possible.  
5. fAegon will probably conquer the realm with ease. He has an elite knight company, the Golden Company. Upcoming support from Dorne, at least the sandy and salty Dornish. Great advisers and is a pretty good kid himself. People predict that the Tyrells will lose some of their bannermen. Tarly, Rowan and Peake might join fAegon. With Tarly also comes the support of some of the crownlands, stormlands and some riverlords so Tarly is the most important bannerman. Aurane Waters might also join fAegon and be legitimized as an Velaryon, this gives fAegon a fleet too.  
fAegon really has no challenge, the Tyrells are busy with the Ironborn and Faith, the Lannisters are busy in the Riverlands.  
And Euron and Stannis are not really a direct threat.

  
The only thing I can't predict is Littlefinger, I think he will conquer the Riverlands but who will he support I don't know.  


Did I miss something? A hidden army? Cersei doing something crazy, Jaime returning and rallying the Freys/Lannisters or the Crannogmen leaving the Neck?

0,1,0,6,13,"I was just reading Davos III from A Clash of Kings and I started to wonder if the names of these ships (and what's happening to them) could be some sort of foreshadowing and symbolism. DISCLAIMER: I'm not saying this was intended by GRRM - he might not have thought that far ahead when writing this, but it's fun to speculate.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Stag of the Sea split one of Joffrey’s galleys clean in two, but **Dog’s Nose was afire** and **Queen Alysanne was locked between Lady of Silk and Lady’s Shame**, her crew fighting the boarders rail-to-rail.

The stag destroying Joffrey's galley isn't that interesting - it's a representation of King Stannis and King Joffrey at war - but what about the others? **Dog's nose** being afire is ironic as Sandor Clegane, aka The Hound, is often called Joffrey's dog and has his fear of fire - this likely foreshadows his desertion soon after, when he gets the scent of smoke. As for **Alysanne** trapped between **Silk** and **Shame**, I'm unsure. Alysanne is long dead, so I'm not sure what this could signify. This is the first we hear of Good Queen Alysanne in the books, with her influence on the Night's Watch not mentioned until ASOS. This could perhaps relate to Cersei or Sansa, as the Queen and To-Be-Queen of the time, both of them having to dress their shame and pain up in silk and pretty dresses.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Directly ahead, Davos saw **the enemy’s Kingslander drive between Faithful and Sceptre**. The former slid her starboard oars out of the way before impact, but Sceptre’s portside oars snapped like so much kindling as Kingslander raked along her side. 

Knowing what we know about A Feast for Crows and the diverging of **Church (Sceptre)** and **Faith (Faithful)** in **King's Landing (Kingslander)** with the actions of Cersei and the High Sparrow, this seems like pretty cool foreshadowing. The only other times the word 'sceptre' is used in the books is to refer to the regency and Faithful obviously signifies the Faith. As these are Stannis' ships however, this could have another meaning. King's Landing follows the Seven, whilst Stannis worships R'hllor. Perhaps this is a visualisation of the people of King's Landing trying to destroy Stannis' fleet due to his false god (particularly as Melisandre is not there to keep Stannis and R'hllor together).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Another \[boulder\], not much smaller, found **Bold Laughter**. The Velaryon galley **exploded like a child’s toy dropped from a tower**, spraying splinters as long as a man’s arm.

Not foreshadowing, but I like how **Bold Laughter** being crushed shows how all joy in this battle on Stannis' side dies in this moment - as well as the childhood of his men ending suddenly (Davos' sons especially).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;He took Black Betha between them, and **struck a glancing blow at Queen Cersei’s ornate carved-and-gilded pleasure barge**, laden with soldiers instead of sweetmeats now.

I like the contrast between Stannis' harsh simplicity and Lannister frivolous splendour here.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Stag of the Sea was fighting fires and boarders both, but **the fiery heart had been raised over Joffrey’s Loyal Man**. **Fury**, her proud bow smashed in by a boulder, was **engaged with Godsgrace**.

A nice little bit of symbolism as Joffrey does not truly have **Loyal Men,** only men that were loyal to his 'father' and grandfather. Also some more on Baratheons fighting with the Faith.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all I've got for now! I know GRRM probably just named the ships for a little wink at some history and not all of them have much meaning, but I enjoyed trying to look a little deeper. Any other thoughts on that Davos chapter? And ship names in general? Perhaps there's more here that I've missed. Many of them were just named after random women so there wasn't much to say there.

0,1,0,20,4,"I noticed that there seems to be a lot of parallels between Catelyn Stark, and Cersei Lannister. 

Both Catelyn ,and Cersei were told by their fathers that they were to marry a prince.

   - Cersei Lannister was told by her father that she would marry Prince Rhaegar Taragaryen of house Targaryen.
  -Catelyn Stark was told by her father that she would marry Lord Brandon Stark the prince of Winterfell .

Both women had lost their  ideal dream husbands in Robert's rebellion ,and we're force to marry someone they didn't know, nor like. All to form political allegiances.

   -Cersei lost Rhaegar, and was force to marry Robert Baratheon.
  -Catelyn lost Brandon, and was force to marry his younger brother Ned Stark


Both Catelyn, and Cersei were happy with their spouses , until they discovered that their spouses were unfaithful. Both Cateyn ,and Cersei was upset with the news that their husbands had father bastards. But each women handle differently.


 -Cersei accepted it, but warn Robert to never bring his backyards kids to court.
- Catelyn was more gracious about Ned's bastard son. She allowed Ned to raise him at           Winterfell along side her own true born kids. But she never let him forget that he 's a bastard.

 Both women are haunted by a woman that their husbands once  💘 loved in their husbands 's past.

   - Cersei is haunted by Robert's love for Lyanna Stark. Cersei do not like it that Robert  
     talks about Lyanna all the time . Which makes Cersei believe he still loves her, more 
     than he loves Cersei.



    - Catelyn is haunted by Ned's love for Jon Snow's mother.  Catelyn do not like it that
      She doesn't know who Jon's Snow's mother is. Ned will not tell her Jon's mother's 
       name. Ned never talks about her at all,and snap at her when she asked about her.

Both Catelyn, and Cersei have their kids advice that they didn't follow, and things
ended badly for them.

   - Cersei advised Joffrey to send Ned to the Wall. He didn't do it. Which started a war.

   -Catelyn advised Rob to marry one of Walder Frey's daughters. He didn't. Instead Rob 
   marry for love, which broke the allegiance with house Frey. Which resulted in them 
   losing the war. 

Both women had watch their first born son die right before their eyes, and we're helpless to stop it.
     
      - Cersei witness Joffrey's death from being poison. 
      -Catelyn witness Rob's death from being stab.

Both women went crazy after losing their children, and both are seeking revenge. 

Cersei and Catelyn have similar fates, and are both tragic figures, yet more people are sympathetic towards Catelyn, while showing nothing but contempt for Cersei.  Why is that? Catelyn can be just as ruthless, and heartless as Cersei when it comes to protecting her family, or obtaining what she wants. 

Have you notice any other parallels between Catelyn, and Cersei that are not mention here? Do you think the parallels between Catelyn and Cersei  are coincidental?, or intentional?

0,1,0,16,32,"I don't know if it's the fact that the Targaryans were so ensconced with taking and holding the iron throne or the fact that I just don't find their deeds very impressive. Sure there were some incredible ones. Aegon I, Jaehaerys I, even Daemon (the dragon leaper) were 3 very impressive Targaryans in their own right, but I just don't get the same vibe I get from the Velaryons. The description and deeds of the Velaryons are how I always pictured the Valyrians of old and here's why.

The Velaryons in the OC (original content) are complete and utter deadbeats of their original counterparts in Fire &amp; Blood. In OC,  they align with Stannis. However, their strength is absolutely pitiful. They send 3-4 ships and sure, it takes down 2 from the royal fleet. But the head of the house is done and we hear little of this house with the exception of Aurane Waters who absconds to the stepstones.

During Fire &amp; Blood, the Velaryons are absolute powerhouses. Compatible if not more influential than the Targaryans. Sure the Targaryans are Dragon riders, but I'll be damned if GRRM hasn't proven time and time again that they're just Womds. Good at intimidation and annihilation but terrible for actually subduing people. (Also, Aegon I's mother was Velaryon). Corlys I Velaryon was LC of Aegons kingsguard. They consistently held master of ships as their title with few exceptions. Not as much hereditarily as much as they had a pretty amazing fleet. They were the ironborn of the narrow sea except without the crazy. From what I've gathered they had a fleet to out the iron fleet to shame and makes the redwine fleet seem meh.

The people themselves are awesome too.  Corlys (Sea Snake) is just crazy cool, he takes his house up to maximum potential and holds an immense sway over the court. He has the strength and power enough to make demands.multiple times of the Targaryans without backing down before, during, and after the Dance of the Dragons. His progeny Laenor is not all that impressive but it has to mean something that Laena bonded with and rode vhagar. Jumping to Laena's (potential) bastard children... addam and Alyn were both awesome as well in their own right.

Addam, my new favorite character, became of a dragon rider of seasmoke. Sure, everyone wanted a chance to ride the dragons, but it's his later actions that lead me to believe that he wanted them to fight for what he believed was right. After the Order 66 on the Dragonseed, Addam decides to prove he's loyal to the Bone and take on the other dragon seed and Dareon T at the second battle of Tumbleton. Although he was dubbed a traitor by Rhaenyra, he travels the riverlands as fast as he can gathering loyal men and marching on Tumbleton. A location hosting an army many times his size and 3 dragons and dragonriders. Amongst those dragons was Vermithor, third only to Vhagar and Balerion. Although the dragons weren't ridden during the battle Addam couldn't have known the enemy forces were imploding and must've known he was going to perish. After trying to wreck Tessarion in the sky, he dive bombed onto Vermithor to destroy him from above. All this to prove his loyalty and that he wasn't a traitor. When his bones finally made it back to driftmark, Alyn puts the epitaph, LOYAL.

Alyn, the oakenfist. Addams brother takes control of driftmark and immediately starts making the same type of demand his grandfather was making of the court, demanding his release threatening mutiny etc. When they convince him on a suicide mission to the ironborn through the stepstones held by pirates and the braavos, he tell the slow, non driftmark fleet to take a nap while he goes and cleans house. Although he gets berated for a poor political decision, they tell him to go on to pyke and clean up that mess which he (seemingly) does. My favorite moment in this entire series is when Alyn heads off to Lys to bring back ""the most valuable treasure for the king"" turning out to be Viserys. I had already known that Viserys survives the war, but this return just propels the Alyn to awesome levels.

I could go on and on about how much I love this family now, but I'm not going to. If GRRM ever dives into Old Valyria, I really hope he models them after the Velaryons. They are like the side kick that the main character really needs and would be entirely screwed without.

GRRM talked about his family history in [Torcon 2003](https://web.archive.org/web/20080323044539/http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0410/theheartofasmall.shtml) (a fantastic and touching talk, absolutely one of the best talks of GRRM), from which we can draw his family tree:

https://i.redd.it/bmhfl2aafu321.png

* Brady House

The Bradys were once the richest in Bayonne. GRRM's mother's father Thomas owned a dock (Brady's Dock) and built a house on Lord Avenue. However, during the Great Depression the Brady family collapsed, they had to sell the dock and the house, moving into ""a modest apartment"".

Later, when GRRM went to school, he would pass before that house and dock everyday, which became the inspiration for the House with the Red Door:

&gt;The house where my mother had grown up . . . the house her father Thomas had built . . . the house where her brother Jimmy once lived, the brother with polio, who built one of the first radio sets in Bayonne and had a pet canary who perched upon his shoulder . . . the house where another brother, Tommy, died of blood poisoning from a boil he’d gotten by swimming in the polluted waters of the Kill Von Kull . . . the *Brady* house. But of course it wasn’t. Someone else lived there now, someone we did not know. I walked past that house twice a day, five days a week, for nine years. And every time I stepped outside my front door, I saw the dock across the street. The dock was surrounded by a chain link fence, but sometimes my friends and I would climb it. From the dock it was easier to reach the oily rocks along the shore when the tide was out. There was a watchman on the dock, though, and if he saw us he’d come out of his shed and shout at us. ""Get out of here, you kids,"" he’d yell. ""You got no business here."" *Yes, I do*, part of me always wanted to shout back, *you’re the one who’s got no business, my great-grandfather BUILT this dock*. I was a shy kid, though, so I never said a word. - GRRM, *Torcon Talk*  
&gt;  
&gt;And it's like , well, that used to be our dock, that used to be our house. Now we don't have a house, we don't have a yard, but I had  always had the sense of...yeah I'm poor, but I come from royalty, or I come from greatness, that somehow was destroyed by the depression by corrupt politicians, by things like that. So maybe that gives me a little of the emotional temperament to understand somebody like Daenerys Targaryen. - GRRM, *South Bank Show*

* Jones House

On the other hand, GRRM's father Raymond's father Louis Martin abandoned his wife Grace Jones, and ran off with a younger woman after Raymond was born in 1921. He didn’t run off very far, though. Bayonne people seldom left Bayonne, so Louis and his new lady only moved about twenty blocks up and three over. GRRM's memory of him resembles Mya Stone's memory of Robert:

&gt;The only memory I have of Grandpa Louis is of him throwing me up in the air and catching me in the dining room of that house on Broadway during one of his infrequent visits. He was laughing and I was terrified, as I recall. - GRRM, *Torcon Talk*

Meanwhile, Raymond and his mother Grace both lived with her own mother, Grandma Jones in the Broadway. Later, when GRRM's parents got married in 1946, they too lived with Grandma Jones, who ruled her house with an iron fist:

&gt;My sisters and I never opened our presents on Christmas morning. Instead we were woken at midnight on Christmas Eve for milk and sugar cookies and gifts. This was a German custom that the Gasmans had brought over from the old country, yet Grandma Jones successfully imposed it on her children, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren, overruling the protests of three generations of non-German spouses.  
&gt;  
&gt;Other instances of her rule were less benign. Her son, Georgie Jones, had problems in school as a boy. Today we might say that he had a learning disorder; back then, it was said that he was ""nervous."" Grandma Jones pulled him out of school and kept him at home. When teachers and truant officers showed up, she ran them off. So Georgie never received any formal education, which condemned him to a life of dependence and menial jobs.  
&gt;  
&gt;And then there was the matter of Aunt Barbry, Grandma Jones’ spinster sister. Aunt Barbry was a woman with a past. Sometime during her youth, she had asserted her independence and run off with a man. An unsuitable man, it would seem, since she soon returned. Family is family, so Grandma Jones took her sister in. But Barbry was a soiled woman, so for the rest of her life she was not allowed to eat with the family. She would help prepare the meals, but while the rest of us ate in the dining room, she would eat her food alone at the kitchen table. As near as I can figure, this went on for fifty years.  - GRRM, *Torcon Talk*

[GRRM in Grandma Jones'](https://i.redd.it/icoabr4ffu321.jpg)

* Project Apartment

Then in 1953, GRRM's parents moved into a new apartment of their own built for low-incoming families called ""projects"", where GRRM spent the rest of his childhood.

&gt;I could sit in my apartment and look out the window. Day and night the freighters would go by, on their way to and from Port Newark, flying the flags of France and Norway and Liberia and half the other nations of the earth. I had a big book of flags I used to look them up in as the ships made their way along the Kill Von Kull. And after dark the lights would shine across the water of the Kill Von Kull. It was only Staten Island, but for me it was Shanghai and Paris, Timbuctoo and Kalamazoo, Marsport and Trantor, and all the other places that I’d never been and could never hope to go. Sometimes I’d go outside and lie in the grass, staring up past the roofs to the distant stars. I knew the names of some of them, Rigel and Sirius and Polaris, Deneb and Altair and Vega. - GRRM, Torcon Talk

# House Locations

So where're these houses and apartments? Are they still there after almost a century? Surprisingly, all of them can be located while sitting comfortably in an armchair, with the aid of Google Maps and US census.

* Brady House

GRRM only told us the Brady House was between 3rd and 4th St. on Lord Avenue. Anthony J. Pelliccio on twitter [remains us](https://twitter.com/A_Pelliccio/status/1072288345026428928) we can use the US census records to find the Brady House. So I repeated his work, and find [the location of Brady House](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ-GRVN-W6Z?i=5&amp;cc=1727033) in the 1910 census.

The rest is easy, we can find it [in Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.649686,-74.1269119,3a,49y,82.19h,96.85t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s3iiZKWRc9E9wFMMC_R2GgQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) in a minute. And you know what? THE DOOR IS INDEED RED!

* Brady Apartment

After the Great Depression, the Bradys moved to ""a modest apartment"". In the [1940 census](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QSQ-G9M1-5N13?i=11&amp;cc=2000219), the Bradys indeed lived in a different place: [21 4th Street](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.650017,-74.1293421,3a,75y,358.96h,92.67t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sOV9ypeBM7_BW96rNvz2qUw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192). Though it looks not that modest compared with the Brady House :)

* Jones House

The US census says it's on 652 Broad way, and [Google Maps shows it lies where Broadway crosses the E30th St.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/652+Broadway,+Bayonne,+NJ+07002/@40.6694685,-74.1131439,109m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c251f1f5bef183:0x400810e965a7d9ad!8m2!3d40.6693557!4d-74.1133573), while [GRRM said](https://web.archive.org/web/20080323044539/http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0410/theheartofasmall.shtml) it's on 31st St. and Broadway. Our two sources match almost perfectly!.

Sadly, it seems the Jones House was replaced by a clinic. In fact, most houses in the Broadway had been sold for commercial uses even back in the 1950s:

&gt;Grandma Jones was a stubborn woman who refused to sell her house even after the rest of Broadway had gone commercial, so ours was the only residence for twenty blocks. -GRRM, *Dreamsongs*

So perhaps after Grandma Jones passed away, the family finally sold out the house.

* Project Apartment

The project apartment is the easiest to find. GRRM said it's on 35 East 1st Street near Brady's Dock, and posted a photo of it. So it's pretty easy to [locate it](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.6454184,-74.1261699,3a,89.9y,356.04h,88.41t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sZplNMSasRm9Nlgl3kkPPhw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192). The building is almost exactly the same, and the Brady's Dock, once renamed to the City Dock during GRRM's childhood, [changed back to the original name](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.6454788,-74.1256067,3a,75y,169.58h,82.33t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sNVxdZ7DAL6wZuqpFILKonA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192), [and GRRM was pleased to learn that](https://youtu.be/fjreiP50DG8?t=3544).

# Family Matters

The US census also revealed a few interesting things about House Martin. From the following table, we can see the Brady House was built between 1900-1910, Thomas Brady passed away during 1930-1940, some name spellings and birth years vary slightly between different surveys, Thomas and Catherine had 11 children in 22 years, Grace Jones lived with her parents since 1940, Louis Martin was not present in the family, GRRM's mother was 2 year senior than her husband, etc. Some are already mentioned in GRRM's Torcon talk.

https://i.redd.it/6dhkwxrlwu321.png

I also tried to find if Louis Martin really moved to only 20 blocks away and lived with his mistress, but couldn't find him in the census of Bayonne. I couldn't find Grace Jones/Martin in the 1920/1930 census, either. Though she appeared in the 1910/1940 census under the Jones family. There was, however, a [Louis Martena](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QS7-89M1-5NTB?i=19&amp;cc=2000219), who lived only with his mother. Louis Martena was 39 in 1940, 1 year younger than Grace Martin. So maybe he was GRRM's grandfather?

0,1,0,13,0,"I know the official story is that Aegon Targaryen was perfect - beat his enemies, united the realm, created the 7 kingdoms. But what we don't read in any of the history books about Aegon is about his faults. And there's one GLARING fault that is monumental - he failed to groom his heirs, get them ready and get the kingdom ready for the day after. That's pretty moronic

Aenys is so clueless when he steps into the role of king, that it's laughable and absurd. He doesn't understand his lords, the Faith, the common folk, he trusts everybody. I think this casts a new light on Aegon, and I think it's a deliberate jab by GRRM when he says that when Aegon dies he was in the middle of telling his grandkids about his conquests. To show his vanity, and the nonsense he was immersing himself in instead of doing what proper kings do, which is divide power and influence among his two sons, while he's alive, making sure they're getting along and know their roles, prepare them for the challenges ahead, etc. I mean, this is really basic stuff. Aenys gives too much to too many people, and you only need rudimentary knowledge about people to understand that it's not effective. And Maegor thinks that fear is all he needs. There's actually some Machiavelli in that (and GRRM is a Machiavelli fan), when he talked about fearing and/or loving the ruler. That you need a combination of those, that if your lords just love you but don't fear you, they'll seize on that weakness. And if they just fear you, they'll end up loathing you, and that's bad for you too. But that's another topic.

My point is that Aegon was far less awesome than the history that was written about him while he was alive would have us believe. I mean, really, every parent prepares their child/ren for the basic challenges of life, and if you leave your kids your family business, you teach them how to run it. And a king has a responsibility to do it for the realm. Well, unless all he wants to do is watch his highlight reels and tell the story of The Field of Fire to his grandkids for the hundredth time.

0,1,0,3,2,"How do you think the war would have progressed if Balon Greyjoy had allied with Robb Stark?

I've been looking at a [timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZsY3lcDDtTdBWp1Gx6mfkdtZT6-Gk0kdTGeSC_Dj7WM/edit#gid=8) to see how it could have worked out and it looks to me like Robb's plan to distract Tywin in the west to open King's Landing to attack would have been unsuccessful. 

**The Original Timeline Up To The Blackwater**

2/18 Catelyn gets an inkling of Robb's plan with news of Tywin at Harrenhal, Renly at Bitterbridge, and sending Theon to Pyke.

3/25 Theon arrives at Pyke after being delayed at Seagard waiting for a ship.

5/15 Balon has been gathering captains to attack the North and will sail to war in two weeks.

6/7 Battle Of Oxcross

6/12 Renly dies.

6/25 Tywin marches west

8/7 Cortnay Penrose is killed

8/16 Roose Bolton takes Harrenhal

8/20- Battle of the Red Fork

8/26 Robb takes the Crag

9/7 Battle of the Blackwater

**The Alternate Timeline**

So let's say in the alternate timeline Theon and Robb are successful in persuading Balon. Maybe the point of departure is that Balon is sane, or that Theon remembers the iron price and Robb phrases his proposal that way, or some combination of marriage alliances and lands in the North (maybe the Flints of Flint's Finger are given the Hornwood lands) is enough to entice Balon to join Robb in attacking the Westerlands.

**Attacking In April**

Since Theon was delayed, he thinks Robb is already at the Golden Tooth. When he convinces Balon on 3/25, ships have already been gathered, though Asha is away rousting more captains (I don't understand why, since only 128 ships were involved in the invasion of the North).

If Balon sails immediately, attacking the Westerlands by April, the situation is very different than when Robb's June invasion in the original timeline. Robb is still at Riverrun. Renly is still at Bitterbridge. Stannis is still at Dragonstone. Roose Bolton hasn't marched to the Ruby Ford.

Would Tywin march then, or wait at Harrenhal? Would he split his army to defend both King's Landing, Harrenhal, and the Westerlands? Would he take the River Road or the Gold Road? 

How would Robb, Renly, and Stannis respond?

**Attacking In June**

Let's say Theon convinces Balon, but he needs more time to convince his captains about the change of plans and gather more troops, and they launch their attack the same time they did on the North in the original timeline, around 5/29. They'd arrive in the Westerlands around the same time Robb does. I assume together they'd defeat Stafford's army, sack Lannisport, and pillage the countryside and coasts.

Because of how events unfolded with Stannis and Renly, June and July is the best time for Tywin to march west. Until 8/7 when Cortnay Penrose dies, Stannis is besieging Storm's End, which would presumably last months. 

But in this scenario Tywin has two forces to face, Robb's army and the ironborn. Would he risk casualties crossing the Red Fork or take the safer route along the Gold Road? Would he attack Riverrun to try luring Robb east?

In the original timeline it took Tywin almost a month to reach the Red Fork from Harrenhal, allowing him to hear about the threat of Stannis. Would Edmure still blunder and block Tywin at the Red Fork? 

**September To November**

9/7 Battle of the Blackwater

9/15-9/16 Catelyn frees Jaime

9/26 Roose orders attack on Duskendale

9/30 Winterfell burned

11/2 Robb returns from the Westerlands

11/2 Battle of Duskendale

11/15 Balon dies

What do you think would have happened after the Battle of the Blackwater? Would Robb and Balon bend the knee? Would Robb and the ironborn turn south and attack the Reach? Would more Tyrell troops be sent into the Riverlands to fight Robb? Perhaps Tyrion would get to command a host, changing events in King's Landing.

In this timeline, Jaime isn't freed, and Robb has nothing forcing him to return home, except for Mance's invasion later on, which Rodrik Cassel could respond to on his own.

On 11/15, Balon is killed. This event is independent of the War of the Five Kings and would probably have still happened. Euron can't return to the Iron Islands as long as Balon lives, and he needs the ironborn to win Daenerys and dragons. With Theon not a captive and winning victories in the Westerlands, would Aeron still call a Kingsmoot? Would Theon have a chance against Euron?

**300 And Beyond**

12/15 Red Wedding

12/18 Attack on Castle Black

1/1 Purple Wedding

1/15 Mance attacks the Wall

1/29 Stannis defeats Mance

1/30 Kingsmoot chooses Euron

2/7 Tyrion kills Tywin

With Winterfell still standing, would Stannis sail North? Or would he sail for Dorne? The Stormlands? The Vale? Essos? Since the ironborn are attacking the west, the Redwyne fleet won't be dispatched to fight Stannis for a while, giving him more time to plan his next move.

1. Let’s begin with the map of the country pre Korean war and post WWII. Korea has a very interesting history but for this purpose I want to look at just these years. After world war two, Korea, the soviet union and US rid Korea of Japanese rule. They agreed on keeping the peninsula separate at the 38th parallel. Sound familiar? The north part of the peninsula is cut off from the south. Look at the placements of the major cities and of Westeros and of Korea. Korea is split into very similar provinces. Korea has 9 where Westeros only has seven.  Winterfell is exactly on the Map where Seoul is. And Kingslanding is exactly where Busan is!  Not to mention Japan is right across the see and has a long history with people who believe in dragons riding horses and trying to conquer the peninsula!!!! Also the weather in Korea is much more similar to the weather in Westeros. It has horrible unending winters.
2. So I looked at this picture of the map of how the war went. I believe that George has always known how the book ends because he has a blue print. If we follow the blueprint then my theory is Winterfell falls very quickly similar to the fall of Seoul in 1950. The dead will destroy everything down to kings landing similar to how the north was unstoppable until they reach Busan. The living will put up a fight and not lose in Kingslanding (busan) perhaps by blowing up bridges and access to the city. Then the u.s general Mcarthy, maybe Theon or Euron along with John and Dany will go up to incheon (moat caitlyn or deep wood motte) and take back Winterfell. Then they will go on a bombing campaign to reinsert dominance. The Korean war (a quick look at wiki) was famous for it having insane dog fights (airplanes resemble dragons) and an insane amount of bombing ( also very dragon like.) 
3. Also the religious undertones in the story are very similar. Korea has a unique history of shamanism and the spirit world that reminds me of the northerns old gods. It took in many different cultures and now has not only buddhism but also a large influence of christianly which obviously reminds me of the seven.
4. TLDR. The map of Korea and the Map of Westoros are way more similar than that of Great Britain and Westeros. The Korean War is the perfect blue print for the war of Ice and Fire. The cities line up, the DMZ and wall are very similar.

0,1,0,25,1,"Throughout ASOIAF, characters commit varying degrees of terrible acts, yet their ‘punishments’ or payback don’t balance out against their crimes.    
The control example is Theon, who seems to be the only character whose misdeeds equal his punishment. Objectively.     
However character such as Joffrey, Jorah, and Brienne either commit heinous crimes and receive little payback (I’ll get back to Joff later) or small crimes and have miserable lives.     
Brienne appears to change alliances several times, some Lords take this against her, and she without doubt receives the most punishment out of everyone, she’s beaten almost constantly,  ridiculed, mocked and nearly raped. I was surprised how many fights she loses.     
Jorah sold slaves, yes that’s terrible, and was exiled. Spies on his queen, exiled again. Then captured by slavers and beaten every day.    
Joffrey is the biggest shit imaginable and causes immeasurable pain for a number of people, and yet had a fairly tame death. Hardly ‘fan service’ for readers.     
Cersei will almost certainly have a fitting death for her crimes, but I don’t think GRRM will make us feel satisfied for it. It will leave a foul taste in the mouth.

0,1,0,36,61,"* While writing ACoK around 1997-1998, GRRM made the 6-Book-Plan and came up with the 5 year gap which would take place after the newly conceptualized ASoS. GRRM’s main problem was that time was not flowing as fast as he’d thought and the three Stark POV kids were staying too young. They needed time and place to grow up and gain the skills they would need in the future. Both ACoK and ASoS were written and published according to this 6-Book-Plan and the 5 year gap. The basic idea for the end of ASoS was to park the Stark kids to their training grounds so that they can “level up” and be ready for the fourth book which would start after 5 years of story time.

* We know that GRRM ditched the 5 year gap after trying to make it work for about a year while writing the fourth book. But one thing keeps bugging me lately. __ASoS arcs for these three Stark kids (Sansa, Arya and Bran) did not end where they were supposed to. When ASoS was finished, these kids had not arrived to their training grounds where they were supposed to level up for 5 years.__ 

* Bran’s ASoS arc ended with him joining Coldhands and passing through the Wall. Bran needed two extra chapters to come into the cave. Only after those two chapters it would make sense to throw a 5 year gap for Bran.

*  Arya’s ASoS arc ended with her boarding a ship destined to Braavos. Arya needed an extra chapter to gain acceptance to the House of Black and White. Only after that chapter it would make sense to throw a 5 year gap for Arya.

* Sansa’s ASoS arc ended with LF murdering Lysa and blaming Marillion. Sansa needed an extra chapter to accept the tutelage of LF. Only after that chapter it would make sense to throw a 5 year gap for Sansa. Indeed, after the first Sansa chapter in AFfC where she accepts to be Alayne, her POV title changed and it is still Alayne to this day.

### What does this all mean?

GRRM does not end story acts randomly.

* [Permalink](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1395)

&gt; He also rejected the idea of just cutting it down the middle, because that would have left the first part without any sort of a climactic end. His analogy is that the series is a symphony and each book is a movement, and explained that he likes each character arc to have some sort of finale in each book, whether it's on a cliffhanger, or a completion of some phase of the character's story arc (or death hehe).

* [Permalink](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1383)

&gt; One thing to consider is that for each book, he likes to end each point of view either on a cliffhanger, or on a full resolution (like a definite death), or on a major change of scene (someone leaving for a new destination or arriving at one.) So he may be a bit reluctant to continue from a particular cliffhanger if he doesn't have time to develop that character to the next good stopping point.

* Sansa’s story arc in ASoS ended up with somewhat a cliffhanger. This was not the case for Bran and Arya. Moreover, neither of them had full resolutions. This would have been achieved if GRRM included Bran I-II ADwD, Arya I AFfC and Sansa I AFfC in ASoS. Bran and Arya could be argued to have “leaving for a new destination” at the end of their ASoS arcs. But still, this would not make them ready for the 5 year gap; not without having Bran I-II ADwD and Arya I AFfC. The same is true for Sansa. It does not make sense to leave Sansa at a cliffhanger at a point she is supposed to be entering into the 5 year gap.

* As a result, I am suspecting that even while writing ASoS, GRRM started noticing the problems with the 6-book-Plan and the 5 year gap. He tried to keep his word to his fans because in cons, he had been repeatedly promising them the 5 year gap. __But the way ASoS was wrapped for the three Stark kids; I think GRRM had already decided that the gap was not going to work when he published ASoS.__

* A possible clue might be Harry the Heir. Several months before GRRM officially announced the abandonment of the 5 year gap, he mentioned Harry the Heir in an SSM. But it seems very tempting to take Harry the Heir as a stand-in for Sweetrobin after the 5 year gap was scrapped and he became too young for certain stuff in store for him. That is similar to Darkstar being a stand-in to Edric Dayne for introducing Dawn to the story (as he would be too young to wield it without the gap). If this is true, that means GRRM had already scrapped the 5 year gap months before he officially announced it and was thinking of stand-ins for some young characters that were unable to do some stuff without the gap.

* Another possible clue is from Bran I ADwD. This chapter and even the next one really should have belonged to ASoS. Recall that Coldhands kills some Night’s Watch men and feeds them to the party in Bran I ADwD. Few readers can make the connection that these Night’s Watch men were mutineers from the Craster’s. That is partly because the mutiny and the clues pointing the identity of these characters were back in ASoS. If these chapters were included in ASoS, it would be much easier to make the connection. The idea of the mutiny was setup in ASoS Prologue and it covers a significant part of early ASoS. The resolution of the mutineers should be naturally expected to take place in ASoS.

* We know that GRRM did not write these ADwD Bran chapters before he published AFfC and started working on ADwD. However, he does a lot of scrapping and rewriting in Bran chapters. Maybe he had lots of scrapped Bran material that he recycled into these first two Bran chapters in ADwD. One thing that seems to support this notion is that there is almost an exact copy of Bran’s recounting Old Nan’s tales, only with a [noticeable retcon](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9r9mi3/spoilers_extended_what_is_the_reason_for_this_old/). This retcon might show that GRRM was not ready to make certain choices back in the day.

0,1,0,14,13,"So far through the series we've seen the lords of the major houses/kingdoms involved in Robert's Rebellion die off in various ways. Arryn, Barratheon, Stark, Lannister and Tully. Balon Greyjoy has also died, but they were indifferent in the rebellion, and Tyrell and Martell were on the Targaryen side. 

That got me thinking about whether there were any parallels on how the lords of the rebellion died, and I started thinking about Ned and Twyin. I think there are some neat parallels in their downfalls - especially in their hubris. For Ned, how and why he died is a lasting topic of debate, but I am of the opinion that Ned's failure to openly use the power as Hand of the King to confront Cersei/Jaime was a major cause of his downfall. He tried to ""play the game of thrones"", chose to trust Littlefinger and relied upon the honor of others to his detriment. He tried to be honorable, he tried to give Cersei a chance to flee, and he paid for it. All the things that make him a good father, role model and lord prevented him from harnessing the ruthlessness needed to survive in Kings Landing. Ultimately, his 'enemies', the Lannisters, overtook and destroyed him.  

Similarly, if you put Twyin in the situation, its difficult to imagine that he would've let someone like Cersei and Littlefinger get the best of him. He could play the game as well as anyone, he knew how to wield his power, and he has all the requisite ruthlessness to prevail in dangerous situations. Yet, those same traits he needed to take control of the West, to run the Kingdoms, to position his family above others, he could not ""turn off"" with his own children. He alienated Tyrion, and to a lesser but still not insignificant extent, Jamie and Cersei. The traits that made him the supreme leader of the land prevented him from being able to connect, empathize and father his children. Ultimately, his son, his family, overtook and destroyed him.    

Anyway, there is nothing monumental about this topic, but I think that its neat that two of the most lordly characters we meet, who were so different in so many ways, were ultimately brought down by the greatest strength that the other one possessed. Ned with his fatherly nurture, and Twyin with his ruthless cunning.  ",1,(Spoilers Main) Parallels in the downfall of Ned and Twyin,2252,58

Pink Letter Theory (because we don't have enough of them) 



  TL/DR – Ramsay is the author of the letter but he didn’t write it.


  Several issues with the pink letter that have caused the tinfoil theories to appear. The big ones namely are: description of seal, style of handwriting is different from Ramsay’s usual writing, &amp; word choice in the letter. To shorten the post, I didn’t include the often brought up passages from ADWD such as the letter itself.

  In the letter several discrepancies are constantly brought up.

  Why does it say that it was sealed with a smudge of pink wax and not an official seal?

 Why doesn’t Jon make a comment about the handwriting when all of times past Jon always notes the spiky large handwriting of Ramsay’s letters?

  Why are certain words used? False king is used instead of Stannis and yet Mance Rayder is specifically named after he’s called the king-beyond-the-wall. Why is the word crow used when this seems to be a word choice not likely used by Ramsay but someone like Mance? How is it that Ramsay knows how many women came with Mance? How does Ramsay know about the wilding princess as well as Mance’s child?

  These descripencies are the reason why so many have speculate that someone else is responsible for the letter. Popular theories include Stannis or Mance being responsible for the letter to illicit a response from Jon, that Asha wrote the letter, or even Ramsay wrote the letter. Some speculate that Mance wrote the letter to include a hidden message to Jon, the Wildings, or both. Some have speculated that Ramsay wrote the letter with lies included. It all stems from the discrepancies. In my effort to reconcile them, I had subscribed to some notions too but it seems like no matter what theory I tried believing it never reconciled the whole picture for me. The handwriting, word choice, and seal were never completely reconciled in a way for me that seemed to fit. Here is my theory that reconciles them all in my mind.

  Take this illustration: An employer might have a secretary write up a letter with the employer telling the secretary generally what they want written. Secretary will write up the letter with perhaps even including their own word choice. The employer will review said letter and approves it. In this situation who is the author and who is the writer? Answer is the employer is the author but the secretary is the writer. Think of Robert’s will and what Ned wrote. Robert was still the author of the letter even though Ned made conscious choice in word usage. Robert was author, Ned was the writer.

  I believe that Ramsay is the author of the letter but instructed someone, likely Mance, what the contents of the letter should be. I believe that everything in the letter is ‘relatively’ true. I also fully believe in the Night Lamp theory. How is all of this possible? Why would Ramsay have Mance do this? How can the letter be true and yet a lie at the same time? Etc. etc.

  I believe that after Theon escapes Winterfell, Ramsay discovers Mance and his spearwives and tortures them gaining information. Ramsay kills the spearwives but keeps Mance alive as he states in the letter.

  Then the battle of Ice occurs. In a Theon sample chapter for Winds of Winter – Stannis tells someone that he may hear reports of Stannis being dead and that it may be true. I believe that Stannis will fake his death in the battle of Ice by giving his magical sword to another person to wield. This imposter will be killed and Ramsay will be in possession of Stannis’ sword. The night lamp theory will hold true and Stannis will be hidden alive somewhere without the Bolton’s realizing it. Where Stannis will be hiding is uknown. This reconciles the fact that Ramsay has Lightbringer, claims Stannis is dead, and this occurs after a seven day battle. However, something that I think will happen is that Ramsay will be injured in this battle. Ramsay’s injury, although likely not life threatening, will prevent him from being able to write a letter himself. Perhaps his arm becomes injured or something to that effect. Frustrated after the battle because he doesn’t have his bride nor Reek back he goes to Mance to further question him.

  Ramsay, believing that his Bride and Reek went toward the wall, tells Mance to write a letter and tells him generally what he wants the contents to say. Mance writes the letter and includes his own word usage such as ‘crow,’ ‘wilding princess,’ etc.

  As a result, the letter is completely true based off Ramsay’s perspective. Ramsay is the author of the letter but not the writer. I don’t think, at this time, that Mance was trying to convey a secret message.

  What about the wax? Many others have speculated about this. Personally, I like the theory that the seal had been opened and resealed by someone in the night’s watch. This is the most logical way to reconcile the matter in my mind.

  So to summarize my ridiculous non-sense tinfoil theory – Ramsay is the author of the letter and had someone else write it on his behalf, likely Mance. The letter doesn’t contain a secret meaning and it reconciles all the discrepancies that are often brought up. With that being said, thank you for reading my theory.

0,1,0,30,24,"I've posted this theory other places before, but have never been on the ASOIAF Reddit before now.  Other places it never got much attention or people disagreed, but there is no doubt in my mind that this is how it will go down.  If this theory is out there already, could someone just link me to an existing thread.  

My theory is that Dany will circumnavigate the globe to arrive at Westeros, and will land on the isle of Lonely Light.  This theory is mostly based off of Quaithe's prophecy which is as follows:

*To go north, you must journey south, to reach the west you must go east. To go forward you must go back and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow*

I'm going to break this down line by line:  
*To go* ***north*** -This means she must get to The North in Westeros where she will be integral in fighting the Whitewalkers.  

*you must journey* ***south*** - This means Dany must leave Meereen and travel south into the Summer Sea.  This will be possible through the aid of the Iron Fleet's ships.

*to reach the* ***west*** - West is Westeros.  We all know she needs to get there at some point.

*you must go* ***east*** - East is east, towards the Jade straits and beyond towards the Sunset Sea.

*To go* ***forward*** - To continue forward on her journey and get out of the Meereenese knot

*you must go* ***back*** - Either back to Westeros, or more likely back to Meereen.  So, she has to go back to Meereen to get out of Meereen

*and to touch the* ***light*** - Light means the isle of Lonely Light in the Iron Islands.

*you must pass beneath the shadow* - Shadow is the Shadowlands/Asshai by the Shadow.  Meaning she must go around Asshai and continue east towards Westeros.  I know GRRM has said we won't see Asshai in the main series, but I believe that we won't see any of this journey other than her departure and arrival on Lonely Light, and maybe also a character recalling some of the more interesting moments from the journey.

I think all the pieces fit into place for this theory.  I think Victarion being with Dany helps this theory.  I'm not sure what that relationship will be exactly, but it doesn't really matter.  Victarion wants to try to outdo his brother Euron, and Euron claims to have made this journey already, so it makes sense that Vic could try to do it and sneak up on Euron the same way Euron did to Balon.  As the Captain of the Iron fleet Vic is also probably familiar with Lonely Light or has crew members that are.  If Dany captures the Iron Islands it would then be a good point to take Casterly Rock, possibly before anyone even realizes she is in Westeros.  This would be easy if Tyrion is with her (which he probably will be), because of his knowledge of Casterly Rocks sewers just like she did in Meereen.

Some other reason I think this theory are true are just due to things things that have been said, like ""no one has ever crossed the Sunset Sea"", which makes me think someone will.  And also, with the word Light having a lot of meaning in the books, why would there be a place called Lonely Light if GRRM wasn't going to use it for something. 

I know most people just assume Dany will follow Aegon I and land at Dragonstone like she did in the show, but I think this is an obvious move that is unlikely to happen.  She has to cross to much hostile territory and there is no way she can make this trip without everyone in Westeros getting word that she is on the way or has landed ion Dragonstone.  My way she could possibly arrive in Westeros undetected and take the II and CR before anyone knows what hit them.  

This is what I think and have for years and I'm very interested on everyone's thought and opinions.  Let me know what you think.  Please don't downvote just because you disagree, upvote so we can get more opinions and discussion! Thanks for reading.

0,1,0,16,19,"So I was at my grandparents house the other day and so were a few of my cousins, who are all 8-12 years younger than me. My grandfather was telling them some stories about Irish legends and folklore, like he used to tell me when I was younger, and he told them the story of the Salmon of Knowledge. As I was listening to the story I realized it reminded me a lot of Bran.

&amp;#x200B;

**The story of the Salmon of Knowledge goes like this:**

There was an ordinary salmon that ate nine hazelnuts that fell into the Well of Wisdom and from nine hazel trees that surrounded the well. As a result, the salmon gained all the world's knowledge and the first to eat of its flesh would gain it's knowledge.

A young Fionn Mac Cumhail, the legendary Irish warrior and hunter who led the band of warriors known as the Fianna and created the famous Giants Causeway was helping the poet Finegas, one of the wisest men in Ireland, who had tried for seven years to catch the fish but to no avail.

Fionn was unaware of the legend about the salmon of knowledge. When Fionn asked Finegas why he spend his days fishing, Finegas would give him no answer. Then one morning, Finegas had caught the salmon.

Finegas gave the fish to Fionn, and told him to cook it with instructions not to eat it. Fionn then built a fire and cooked the salmon, however when he was turning it, he burnt his finger on a drop of hot fish fat. Fionn sucked on his burned finger to ease the pain. Unbeknownst to Fionn, all of the salmon's wisdom had been concentrated into that one drop of fat.

When he brought the cooked meal to Finegas, Finegas saw that the Fionn's eyes shone with an unseen wisdom. Finegas asked Fionn if he had eaten any of the salmon, to which Fionn answered no, and Fionn proceeded to explain what had happened. Finegas realized that Fionn had received the wisdom, so gave him the rest of the salmon to eat. Fionn ate the salmon and in so doing gained all the knowledge of the world. Fionn could from then on draw upon this knowledge from the salmon by biting his thumb.

Fionn is connected to many of the legends of the Fenian Cycle in Irish mythology, however it is this tale where he first came to prominence.

&amp;#x200B;

**The similarities to Bran:**

* Both Fionn and Bran are young boys how are given great knowledge that marks the beginning of their epic journeys.
* In the story, Fionn gains the knowledge of the world through an injury, and the beginning of Bran's metaphysical awakening truly begins after he is crippled by Jaime.
* The origin of the knowledge gained by Fionn and Bran derives from trees. Hazel trees in Fionns case and Weirwoods and Bran's.
* Both have a wise, older mentor who guides them in their story. Finegas for Fionn and Bloodraven for Bran.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Fish:**

Bran himself actually has quite a bit of Salmon of Knowledge symbolism as well.

* An interesting thing to note in regards to these to stories is the animal from which Fionn gains his knowledge, a salmon. Salmon are closely related to another kind of fish, the trout.
* Bran's mother is Catelyn Tully, whose family sigil is a trout.
* Bran himself actually has the Tully look of auburn hair and blue eyes, not the traditional Stark look.
* In Irish mythology the fish also represents renewed and sustained life, which fits with Bran surviving his ordeal with the tower and the Catspaw, who his mother Catelyn (a trout) helped protect him from.

&amp;#x200B;

**Irish influences with Bran's name:**

The Salmon isn't the only Irish influence on Bran however:

* **Bran** was the name of one of the dogs belonging to the aforementioned, Fionn Mac Cumhail.
* The names **Branaddov** meaning '**Black Raven**' and **Branogenos** meaning '**Raven Born**' are both inscribed on Ogham stones (Ogham is the earliest form of writing in Ireland) in Gearha South, Co. Cork and Barnaveddoge, Co. Louth respectively.
* Breandán is an Irish name meaning 'prince' that was Anglicised to Brendan or **Brandon**.

&amp;#x200B;

**Side note:**

GRRM has confirmed that he has taken inspiration from Irish mythology in the past in an email to Tommy Patterson in which GRRM compares the Others to the Sidhe:

&gt;""'The Others are not dead. They are strange, beautiful… think, oh… **the** **Sidhe** **made of ice**, something like that… a different sort of life… inhuman, elegant, dangerous.'""

The Sidhe are a race in Irish mythology akin to fairies or elves, who are said to live underground in fairy mounds, across the western sea, or in an invisible world that coexists with the world of humans.",1,(Spoilers Extended) Bran Stark the Trout of Knowledge,4572,53

Simple question, right? Some people say that it's as simple as *""we don't choose who they love""*. I disagree. Both because i don't think that what they have is actually love and because there are actually a bunch of reasons why the twins *chose* to become sexually involved.

# Absent parents

&gt;He could never bear to be long apart from his twin. Even as children, they would creep into each other’s beds and sleep with their arms entwined. Even in the womb. Long before his sister’s flowering or the advent of his own manhood, they had seen mares and stallions in the fields and dogs and bitches in the kennels and played at doing the same. Once their mother’s maid had caught them at it... he did not recall just what they had been doing, but whatever it was had horrified Lady Joanna. She’d sent the maid away, moved Jaime’s bedchamber to the other side of Casterly Rock, set a guard outside Cersei’s, and told them that they must never do that again or she would have no choice but to tell their lord father. They need not have feared, though. It was not long after that she died birthing Tyrion. Jaime barely remembered what his mother had looked like.

While it's definitely uncomfortable to think about, it's also quite understandable. The taboo of incest is a social construct, not something people know instinctively. They saw animals do it and repeated it in their games. Because that's what children do - they repeat.

So while Jaime cites this as the earliest example of them ""belonging together"", i disagree. The real problem is that no one was around to tell them not to do it when it first happened. And after Joanna died, no one who even knew about the incident.

I'm not sure if Joanna's reaction and solution - separating them and threatening to tell Tywin - was right either, but at least she did something. Tywin, on the other hand, was too busy to bother with things like raising children.

# Lannister is worth more

But while the lack of parenting from Tywn was  definitely a problem, the parenting they did get from him was even worse in this regard.

First of all, he failed in the most basic stuff:

&gt;“You cannot eat love, nor buy a horse with it, nor warm your halls on a cold night,” she heard him tell Jaime once, when her brother had been no older than Tommen.

He never taught his children to love each other. He taught them all about respecting and defending the Lannister name, but forgot to tell them to respect and love each other as individuals (because he himself only loved them as a reflection of his ideas and dreams). So is it really surprising, that his kids' perception of love is completely twisted?

Another thing to consider is how Tywin's obsession with Lannister name pushed Jaime and Cersei to incest. Because Tywin taught his children that being a Lannister is a huge  privilege. That Lannisters are special. ""Taking pride in your family name"" is pushed to the extreme and turns into ""we are superior to everyone else"".

Tyrion's *""he gave me a gold coin to pay her, because I was a Lannister, and worth more""* is the most obvious and extreme example of such philosophy, but the idea of Lannister superiority is ever present in every interaction they have with the world.

Tyrion managed to reject this worldview (at least to some extent), because due to his dwarfism he wasn't really treated as superior, and the abuse he suffered from Tywin made him think of his lessons more critically. Jaime and Cersei bought into this completely.

They view Lannister as the golden standard and everyone else as second-class and a potential enemy. So them choosing the lover from their own family makes total sense. Especially given the fact that Tywin did it too. Obviously, Joanna wasn't his sister, but she was still a Lannister of Casterly Rock.

And the twins (especially Cersei) look up to their father. He is their role model.

# We all dream of the thing we can not have

The appeal of incest in general is that it is taboo. People are temped by forbidden. Obviously, the excitement of doing something they shouldn't is a huge part of Jaime and Cersei dynamic. Cersei especially seems to love the risk, ever since her childhood:

&gt;Cersei paced her cell, restless as the caged lions that had lived in the bowels of Casterly Rock when she was a girl, a legacy of her grandfather’s time. She and Jaime used to dare each other to climb into their cage, and once she worked up enough courage to slip her hand between two bars and touch one of the great tawny beasts. She was always bolder than her brother. The lion had turned his head to stare at her with huge golden eyes. Then he licked her fingers. His tongue was as rough as a rasp, but even so she would not pull her hand back, not until Jaime took her by the shoulders and yanked her away from the cage  
&gt;  
&gt;“Your turn,” she told him afterward. “Pull his mane, I dare you.” He never did. I should have had the sword, not him.

Her having sex with her own brother in an  abandoned  tower or next to her drunk and asleep husband is more of that.

But there is more. Remember, they were told that Lannisters are not like everyone else. What's forbidden for everyone else should not bother them.  Lannisters are entitled to do what they want. Their father was committing war crimes and breaking sacret laws left and right. So why should they bother about taboos and such?

Once again, you can see that Cersei had such mindset since the early days.

&gt;The girl with the golden curls put her hands upon her hips. “Give us our foretelling, or I’ll go to my lord father and have you whipped for insolence.”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Aye.” Malice gleamed in Maggy’s yellow eyes. “Queen you shall be... until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Anger flashed across the child’s face. “If she tries I will have my brother kill her.”

Everything will happen like i want it to and no one will stop me. That's how Cersei thinks. So of course she would act on her  incestuous desires.

# The Targaryen precedent

The fact that Targaryens practiced incest definitely played a part. First of all, it's yet another example of Lannister entitlement. If Targaryens can do it, there is no reason the Lannisters can't do it.

So when Ned confronts Cersei, this is the first line of her defense:

&gt;""Since we were children together. And why not? The Targaryens wed brother to sister for three hundred years, to keep the bloodlines pure.

But another interesting thing is that Cersei was suppose to marry Rhaegar. She grew up believing that.

&gt;The memory of the rejection still rankled, even after all these years. Many a night she had watched Prince Rhaegar in the hall, playing his silver-stringed harp with those long, elegant fingers of his. Had any man ever been so beautiful? He was more than a man, though. His blood was the blood of old Valyria, the blood of dragons and gods. When she was just a little girl, her father had promised her that she would marry Rhaegar. She could not have been more than six or seven. “Never speak of it, child,” he had told her, smiling his secret smile that only Cersei ever saw. “Not until His Grace agrees to the betrothal. It must remain our secret for now.” And so it had, though once she had drawn a picture of herself flying behind Rhaegar on a dragon, her arms wrapped tight about his chest. When Jaime had discovered it she told him it was Queen Alysanne and King Jaehaerys.

I wonder if her engaging in a sexual relationship with Jaime was, at least in part, another way of drawing a picture with Rhaegar. Jaime was the closest thing to a beautiful young prince that she had and the fact that he was her brother fit rather well with Targaryen sensibilities.

# Figthing the misogyny

But the most fascinating aspect of Jaime-Cersei incest for me is how Cersei uses it as a way to fight back against the sexism of the world.

Every female character in ASOIAF deals with it in their own way. We have someone like Catelyn, who accepts and embraces her role in this society. Or people like Asha and Brienne, who take on male roles for different reasons. And then there is Cersei.

&gt;Men had been looking at her that way since her breasts began to bud. Because I was so beautiful, they said, but Jaime was beautiful as well, and they never looked at him that way. When she was small she would sometimes don her brother’s clothing as a lark. She was always startled by how differently men treated her when they thought that she was Jaime. Even Lord Tywin himself...

She was always aware of the sexism around her. She always wanted to be able to do the things Jaime does. What's most interesting about Cersei is how she chose to response to the world around her being so male driven. She doesn't think it's wrong. In fact, she herself has a very low opinion of amost every woman in the story. In Cersei's mind, the injustice of the system is not how it treats women. Only how it treats her. For her, the perfect world is not the one where women can be respected and powerful. but the one where she is a man.  *I should have had the sword, not him.*  *By all rights, you ought to be in skirts and me in mail.*

&gt;We were so much alike, I could never understand why they treated us so differently. Jaime learned to fight with sword and lance and mace, while I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, while I was to be sold to some stranger like a horse, to be ridden whenever my new owner liked, beaten whenever he liked, and cast aside in time for a younger filly. Jaime's lot was to be glory and power, while mine was birth and moonblood.""

Jaime is who she wants to be. Her exact copy, except male. So her sexual attraction to him is a mix of narcissism and a wish  fulfillment.

But wait, there is more.  It's not just Cersei initiating these relationship that is a response to misogyny of the world. Her continuing this relationship even after marriage and having kids with Jaime is exactly that too.

Cersei didn't love Robert. Cersei suffered abuse from Robert. So she used her own body, her own sexuality, to fight back:

&gt;Ten thousand of your children perished in my palm, Your Grace, she thought, slipping a third finger into Myr. Whilst you snored, I would lick your sons off my face and fingers one by one, all those pale sticky princes. You claimed your rights, my lord, but in the darkness I would eat your heirs.

This is one of the most disturbing passages in the whole series, as far as i am concerned. And it's so perfectly fitting. This is Cersei's response to emotional and physical abuse from her husband. She eats his heirs in the darkness and makes new ones with her own brother.

&gt;As soon as Cersei closed her eyes, the king would steal off to console the poor lonely creature. One night she had Jaime follow him, to confirm her suspicions. When her brother returned he asked her if she wanted Robert dead. “No,” she had replied, “I want him horned.” She liked to think that was the night when Joffrey was conceived.

The children are Cersei's ultimate ""fuck you"" to Robert and the whole world that made her a woman, destined to be sold to some stranger like a horse. She is the extreme example of how the sexism of society and abuse can fuck a person up.

# Conclusion

To sum it up, there were a lot of reasons for Jaime and Cersei becoming sexually involved. Obviously, their choices are their responsibility first and foremost. But we have to acknowledge the fact, that they are the product of their parenting and the society they live in as well. All this made them who they are and pushed them to these incestuous relationship.

***

**TL;DR:** Doran has ""saturnine gout"", caused by chronic lead poisoning from the lead sugar used to sweeten his beloved ""sweet heavy strongwine"". His gout and elements of his story are a riff on the story of the infamously gout-afflicted real world King Charles I of Spain AKA Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.

##All About Doran's Gout
Doran has gout. Why might that be, and what is the purpose of giving him gout?

Gout was [historically/colloquially believed to be caused by excessive alcohol consumption](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.1780080442/pdf). We absolutely see Doran drink and indeed show a ""love"" for *""sweet, heavy strongwine""*:
&gt;[Doran] ate a bit of it, and drank a cup of **the sweet, heavy strongwine that he loved. When it was empty, he filled it once again.** (CotG)

Each of the Martells in general seems to like to drink in their own way, too. Thus we see Selmy tell Dany Quentyn is…
&gt;""Drinking with his knights"" (DWD Dae VIII)

…and when Quent subsequently appears, his face is ""flushed and ruddy"". Dany assumes he's drunk on wine (just like Elder Brother):
&gt;Too much wine, the queen concluded… (ibid.)

We also see Quentyn *really* savor a glass of wine in the dark and pour himself another, much as Doran did, above:
&gt;Quentyn… poured himself a cup of wine and drank it in the dark. **The taste was sweet solace on his tongue, so he lit a candle and poured himself another.** (DWD tDT)

Oberyn swills wine like water:
&gt;""Is it Dornish wine you're drinking?"" [said Oberyn.]

&gt;""From the Arbor.""

&gt;Oberyn made a face. ""Red water.""

&gt;…

&gt;""I think I may drink some of Lord Redwyne's grape juice after all.""

&gt;""As you like."" Tyrion served him a cup.

&gt;The man took a sip, sloshed it about in his mouth, and swallowed. ""It will serve, for the moment. I will send you up some strong Dornish wine on the morrow."" He took another sip. (SOS Ty IX)
***
&gt;Tyrion found Prince Oberyn drinking a cup of red wine as he donned his armor. He was attended by four of his younger Dornish lordlings. ""Good morrow to you, my lord,"" the prince said. ""Will you take a cup of wine?""

&gt;""Should you be drinking before battle?""

&gt;**""I always drink before battle.""** (SOS Ty X)

Arianne likewise really enjoys her wine:
&gt;When [Arianne] **required** more wine, Timoth would fetch it. (FFC PitT)
***
&gt;When [Arianne and Tyene] were ten Arianne had stolen a flagon of wine, and the two of them had gotten drunk together. (PitT)
***
&gt;Cedra glanced up shyly at his name and almost spilled the wine that she was pouring [for Arianne]. (PitT)
***
&gt;[Arianne] drank a little wine to settle her stomach. (PitT)

She seems to prefer her wine strong and she makes fun of Arys's low tolerance for alcohol:
&gt;[Arys:] ""I was drunk when I said that.

&gt;[Arianne:] ""You'd had three cups of watered wine."" (FFC tSK)

She also tacitly informs us that the Dornish as a whole are a drunken bunch when she says the ""Drunken Dornishman"" Inn was ""aptly named"". (TWOW Ari II)

Thus we might simply conclude that Doran has gout because he, like a typical Martell and typical Dornishman, drinks too much.

In truth, though, while [booze isn't *good* for gout](https://goutandyou.com/gout-and-alcohol/), clinically [*fructose* is a greater villain](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1577110/Fruit-juice-more-likely-to-cause-gout-than-alcohol.html). Thus Doran's orange-eating—
&gt;He had decided to break his fast before he went, with a **blood orange** and a plate of gull's eggs diced with bits of **ham** and fiery peppers. (CotG)
***
&gt;""We were eating oranges."" - Doran Martell (CotG)

—is probably worse for his gout than his alcohol consumption, per se (notwithstanding the fact that vitamin C *on its own* may slightly lower one's risk of *contracting* gout in the first place). Besides all the oranges he eats, [the purine-rich ham he puts in his eggs is especially bad for him,](https://www.healthbeckon.com/purine-rich-foods-to-avoid/) while the dates Dorne is known for (along with its fruit in general)—
&gt;A fortnight past, a trader had been butchered in the shadow city, **a harmless man who'd come to Dorne for fruit and found death instead of dates.** (FFC tSK)

—are a veritable fructose bomb.

##Not Simply Gout, But *Saturnine* Gout
All that having been said, I *strongly* suspect that Doran's gout is not about his alcohol consumption, per se, nor even all that fruit. Rather, I suspect his gout is [*""saturnine gout""*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2661030), which is caused by [lead poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning). Lead sugar AKA ""salt of Saturn"" AKA lead acetate [was often added to wine in and after the Middle Ages](https://books.google.com/books?id=xXVEKN79diAC&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;ots=ISV-ij7tk4&amp;dq=lead%20sugar%20fortified%20wine%20middle%20ages&amp;pg=PA287#v=onepage&amp;q=lead%20sugar%20fortified%20wine%20middle%20ages&amp;f=false) to sweeten and/or preserve it. And what kind of wine does Doran love?
&gt;sweet, heavy *[like lead!]* strongwine

Sounds like wine sweetened with lead sugar to me, especially given (a) lead's colloquial reputation as quintessentially ""heavy"" and (b) GRRM's love of wordplay.

Sure enough, the distinguishing features of saturnine gout perfectly coincide with Doran's symptoms. Unlike normal gout, which tends to afflict one or perhaps two joints only and most frequently the joint at the base of the big toe, bouts of saturnine gout ""tend to occur in the knee"" and ""are frequently polyarticular"", meaning they affect many joints at once. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2661030) Indeed, Doran's knees are a huge problem, and his gout is *very* polyarticular:
&gt;The gout had swollen and reddened his joints grotesquely; his left knee was an apple, his right a melon, and his toes had turned to dark red grapes, so ripe it seemed as though a touch would burst them. (FFC CotG)

Doran has other subtle symptoms that are consistent with lead poisoning/saturnine gout as well. Consider these descriptions of Doran:
&gt;…they found Doran Martell seated behind a cyvasse table, his gouty legs supported by a cushioned footstool. He was toying with an onyx elephant, turning it in his **reddened, swollen hands.** The prince looked worse than she had ever seen him. **His face was pale and puffy, his joints so inflamed that it hurt her just to look at them.** (FFC PitT)
***
&gt;Beneath the coverlet, **his legs were pale, soft, ghastly. Both of his knees were red and swollen, and his toes were almost purple, twice the size they should have been.** (DWD tW)
***
&gt;[Doran] sounded so sad, **so exhausted, so weak.** (FFC PitT)
***
&gt;When he raised his head to look at her, **his dark eyes were clouded with pain. Is that the gout?** Arianne wondered. (PitT)
***
&gt;In the shade of the orange trees, the prince sat in his chair with his gouty legs propped up before him, and **heavy bags beneath his eyes . . . though whether it was grief or gout that kept him sleepless, Hotah could not say.** (CotG)
***
&gt;The prince leaned back against his pillows and closed his eyes, but Hotah knew **he did not sleep. He is in pain.** (CotG)
***
&gt;**Sometimes in the deep black hours of the morning sleep found him in his chair.** (CotG)
***
&gt;The prince sat in his high seat beneath the Martell spear, **his face pale with pain.** (CotG)
***
&gt;Look, **his hand is shaking.** The Prince of Dorne is terrified. (tSK)
***
&gt;[Doran's] legs had been useless for three years, but there was still some strength in his hands and shoulders. (DWD tW)

Doran's *generalized* pain, exhaustion and weakness, his insomnia (complete with more wordplay surrounding lead's weight: he has *""heavy* bags under his eyes""), his hand tremors (if not feigned for Arys's benefit) and his mostly pallid complexion combined with the lividity (blood pooling/dark color/swelling) in his hands and lower body is likewise consistent with chronic [lead poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning).

Another symptom of lead poisoning is loss of appetite (whereas common gout is associated with *overconsumption*), and Doran certainly doesn't seem the hungry sort:
&gt;A serving man brought him a bowl of purple olives, with flatbread, cheese, and chickpea paste. **He ate a bit of it**, and drank a cup of the sweet, heavy strongwine that he loved. 

Chronic common gout leads to the formation of ""tophi""—white, chalky deposits of uric acid crystals which can break through the skin—whereas ""tophi rarely develop"" in cases of saturnine gout. And lo! There's no hint of tophi in the descriptions of Doran's gout symptoms.

Given the medical evidence, it's safe to say that Doran's beloved strongwine is the primary cause of his troubles. (In a certain unusual sense, then, it can be said that Doran *does* have a drinking problem of sorts after all. It's just not the alcohol that's causing the problem.)

##The ""Saturnine"" Giveaway
While the medical evidence adds up, for me there's an even better, textually-coded reason to believe that Doran has saturnine gout. Remembering that saturnine gout is caused by lead poisoning, isn't it interesting that Doran's brother Oberyn is (a) a master poisoner and (b) literally called ""saturnine"" *in juxtaposition to a reference to Doran's gout""*
&gt;**""My brother's health requires he remain at Sunspear.""** The princeling removed his helm. Beneath, his face was lined and **saturnine**, with thin arched brows above large eyes as black and shiny as pools of coal oil. (SOS Ty V)

Ladies and gentlemen: GRRM.

##The Charles I/V Parallel
Doran's gout is clearly riffing on the story of one of real-world history's most infamous gout sufferers: [Spain's King Charles I AKA Holy Roman Emperor Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor).

Charles didn't marry until he was 25—*very* late in life for his era and station. Doran likewise married *very* late for a firstborn highborn man of Westeros: Given that Doran is 52 at the beginning of AFFC, in very early 300 AC—
&gt;Though he was but two-and-fifty, Doran Martell seemed much older. (FFC CotG)

—he was likely 25 c. 273, when he did not sail to Casterly Rock with his mother and siblings because…
&gt;…Doran was [as yet merely] betrothed to Lady Mellario of Norvos… (SOS Ty X)

Much as King Charles famously fell in love with his wife at first sight, so did Doran and Mellario fall for one another at first sight—
&gt;""I saw Volantis once, on my way to Norvos, where I first met Mellario. The bells were ringing, and the bears danced down the steps. Areo will recall the day.""

&gt;""I remember,"" echoed Areo Hotah in his deep voice. ""The bears danced and the bells rang, and the prince wore red and gold and orange. My lady asked me who it was who shone so bright.""

&gt;Prince Doran smiled wanly. (FFC PitT)

—such that It Is Known that he ""married for love"". (DWD tDT)

Perhaps most obviously, Charles was infamously carried from place to place in a sedan chair due to the pain of his gout, just as Doran transported by litter, unable to walk or even ride.

King Charles was famous for something else, too: a famously enlarged lower jaw. And what do you know, Doran's son Quentyn *""heavy jaw""* that is *""too square""*, which Doran seems to share, as Arianne says Quentyn both *""looks like""* and *""looks too much like""* Doran. (DWD Dae VII; tMM; FFC PitT; WOW Ari I)

Two Doran-Charles connections are more playful. First, Charles's love was Isabella of Portugal. Portugal is, of course, famous for the production of Port, which ""coincidentally"" could be described rather perfectly as a *""sweet heavy strongwine""* like the one Doran ""loved"".

Second, while Charles's wife Isabella gave birth to five children in total, two of her sons died as infants, leaving her with three children who grew to adulthood. This just so happen to prefigure what we're told about Doran's *mother*:
&gt;""**I was the oldest**,"" the prince said, ""and yet I am the last. After **Mors and Olyvar died in their cradles**, I gave up hope of brothers. **I was nine when Elia came**, a squire in service at Salt Shore. … And **a year later Oberyn arrived**, squalling and kicking."" (FFC CotG)

All these allusions to King/Emperor Charles are fascinating. To the extent that some people have [speculated that Charles suffered from *saturnine* gout](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc062352), much like [many believe the Romans did](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/leadpoisoning.html), the parallel could even help reinforce the idea that Doran's gout is saturnine, caused by the lead sugar used to sweeten his wine.

##The Point
Neat, huh? For many, parallels and references like this are simply ""easter eggs"", interesting little nuggets that are ""cool"" and little else.

Personally, I think they're an inherent part of GRRM's greater project, part of a web of references pointing to in-world truths that ASOIAF has yet to even let us know we don't know. (We are all all Jon Snows to GRRM's Ygritte, here.) The *much* larger writing from pieces of this writing were extracted, reworked and expanded upon here (a reworking which I have subsequently gone back and overlaid into the original) argues that House Nymeros-Martell has two major players in interesting places that readers do not yet realize are Martells. Specifically, that writing argues that Archmaester Marwyn the Mage is a Martell, and that Elder Brother of Quiet Isle, who has no name and who tells Brienne he ""died"" at the Trident, is in fact none other than the ""late"" Prince Lewyn of Dorne, who I argue is Marwyn's younger brother.

And wouldn't you know it? Marwyn has a King Charles-esque ""slab of jaw"", while Elder Brother has a ""heavy jaw"", also called a ""thick square jaw"". (FFC Sam V, B VI) What's more, if I'm correct that Elder Brother is a former prince of Dorne who's now retired to the monastic retreat on Quiet Isle, this sets up a *huge* parallel to history's most famous gout sufferer, Charles V. How so?

Charles famously abdicated all his titles and *retired to a monastery*, which is exactly what I argue Doran's uncle Lewyn did after the Battle of the Trident. What's more, Charles famously *staged his own death and resurrection* at the monastery—
&gt;…about six months before his death Charles staged his own funeral, complete with shroud and coffin, after which he ""rose out of the coffin, and withdrew to his apartment, full of those awful sentiments, which such a singular solemnity was calculated to inspire."" ([wikipedia: Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor), quoting a famous 19th century biography of Charles)

—which is in essence what I believe Lewyn Martell did when he was ""reborn"" as a monk on Quiet Isle:
&gt;""When I died in the Battle of the Trident…"" - Elder Brother (FFC B VI)
***
&gt;""I woke here, upon the Quiet Isle. The [old] Elder Brother told me I had washed up on the tide, naked as my name day. I can only think that someone found me in the shallows, stripped me of my armor, boots, and breeches, and pushed me back out into the deeper water. The river did the rest. We are all born naked, so **I suppose it was only fitting that I come into my second life the same way.** I spent the next ten years in silence."" - Elder Brother (FFC B VI)

If you want to know more about these wacky hypotheses, you can check out my Secret History of House Martell, Chapter 1 via these links: [PART ONE](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/a412o1/spoilers_extended_the_secret_history_of_house/), [PART TWO](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/a417d4/spoilers_extended_the_secret_history_of_house/), and [PART THREE](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/a419qf/spoilers_extended_the_secret_history_of_house/). For what it's worth, I also think there's another way that the parallel to King Charles I/Emperor Charles V points to Martell assets in places that have not yet been made obvious to the reader, but that will have to wait for the next chapter in my Secret History of House Martell series.

Of course, maybe I'm just imagining things, and all there is to ""see"" here is the idea that Doran has saturnine gout/lead poisoning and that his story is a riff on *a few* elements of the story of King/Emperor Charles I/V, but not the parts about retreating to a monastery or staging his own death and resurrection. Anyway, regardless of whether you buy the tinfoil, the ""saturnine gout""/Charles I/V allusions are some fun shit. GRRM, everybody!

So, GRRM has suggested that The Winds of Winter will be the darkest of the series so far, and I can definitely see that. We will probably have

* Jon Connington committing unforgivable atrocities as Aegon fights for the Iron Throne

* Dany choosing ""Fire and Blood"" over appeasement after Meereen falls under siege

* Victarion either taking a dragon or going the way of Quentyn (or both!)

* Stannis drowning Freys in a frozen lake

* Hell, Stannis going through a frozen hell to beat the Boltons and still losing the North's support when the Starks return

* Davos sailing to Skagos and maybe [going to Hardhome](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/98zioj/spoilers_extended_a_theory_about_a_certain/)

* Jon Snow coming back after being betrayed and living a ""second life"" inside Ghost - he'll probably forsake the war against the others after being *literally fucking murdered* for doing what he thought was right

* The tragic fates of Tommen and Myrcella

* Euron's eldritch shenanigans and a giant blood sacrifice in Oldtown

* Sam and the Horn of Joramun

* Cersei's descent into madness, and the death of Margaery

Strangely enough, it looks like Tyrion, Sansa, and Arya might have the *""happier""* POV's for once!

But that's not what I would like to talk about. I want to discuss Jaime, Brienne, and Lady Stoneheart, and the dark turn their story might take in the next book.

In my mind, there are two possibilities I'm torn between. These aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, mind you.

**The Red Wedding 2: 2 Red 2 Wed**

So, the Red Wedding 2.0 theory suggests that the bros without ~~hoes~~ banners, under the leadership of Lady Stoneheart, will butcher all the Freys when Daven Lannister marries a Frey in Riverrun. [Here's a short write up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/whcd0/spoiler_all_red_wedding_20/)

So... What does this mean? What makes this dark? Well, GRRM is all about giving us what we think we want without giving us what we want. From Joffrey's death to Dany's Sack of Astapor to Jon's ascension to Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, these brief triumphs have consequences that push our favorite characters into hard situations and tough choices. Hell, *Jon fucking dies* for his decisions as Lord Commander. 

So how would the Red Wedding 2.0 go down? Would it be the triumphant deal of Justice to the most hated House in Westeros, by readers and characters alike? Or, as I suspect, will it go too far and leave a bitter taste in our mouths?

Consider the current leader of the Brotherhood without Banners: Lady Stoneheart. She's watched her son get butchered by the Boltons and the Freys, and Roose Bolton specifically said *Jaime Lannister sends his regards*. As a result, she wants vengeance against the three families for what they did. Not Justice, *Vengeance*. So far, we've seen the Brotherhood hang Freys and Boltons and Lannisters wherever they find 'em, as we saw in the epilogue of *A Storm of Swords*, but Brienne learns that Lady Stoneheart has little interest in trials and such. She wants nothing more than to do to Walder Frey what Tywin Lannister did to the Tarbecks and the Reynes. 

So who's in Riverrun? We know there's a major allieance being formally cemented there. Daven Lannister is Cersei's chosen Warden of the West, and he's marrying a Frey, who control both Riverrun and the Twins. So we can count on a lot of Freys and Lannisters being in attendance. Emmett Frey, the husband of Jaime's Aunt Genna Lannister, will be there too, likely with his wife. Would unCat balk at slaughtering innocent Freys and Lannisters? The wives and children of those who wronged her and her son? 

No. And that's why if we see the Red Wedding 2.0, it won't be satisfying. It'll be dark. Super dark. A massacre of innocents by the Brotherhood would be extremely uncomfortable to read, I think.

But there's another possibility for the Brotherhood, one that connects the Brotherhood without Banners to two characters we've come to love: Ser Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth.


**Brienne of Tarth, Oathbreaker**

So, Brienne's last chapter results in her, Pod, and Hyle Hunt getting captured by Lady Stoneheart's gang. Brienne has to confront a version of Catelyn Stark from her worst nightmares, one who sees her as having broken her oaths. Before you jump down my throat about how this is a sham trial and LSH has no reason to accuse Brienne of treason, remember that Brienne has

* carrying a Lannister sword *made out of Ice*

* carrying a scroll saying she's conducting the King's business - i.e., she's working for the Lannisters

* probably been saying ""Jaime"" in her delirium.

Is that circumstantial and tenuous? Yes. For someone like Lady Stoneheart, that's probably enough, and she's given a two page trial before being hanged. Either way, we are later led to believe that Brienne agrees to bring Jaime to Lady Stoneheart, and shit's gonna hit the fan when that happens.


[Here's a good prediction, I think.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/7xvqii/spoilers_main_i_think_brienne_will_kill/)

So, what does this mean? Let's break it down.

First, LSH wants to kill Jaime. That's a fact, and there's no way she lets him go. *""Jaime Lannister sends his regards""*. Yeah, Lady Stoneheart never forgives. 

But what about the Blackfish? Well, his words are *Family, Duty, Honor*, and he thinks the Kingslayer is as low as dirt. So he'll side with LSH over Jaime, even if he thinks LSH is going too far. The only think that could perhaps sway him would be LSH threatening Edmure, Roslin, and Jeyne. But Jaime, no, he'll never help Jaime, I think.

So how might all this play out? I think Jaime might fight a trial by combat, or try to protest his innocence somehow. And LSH will not let it fly. She might order Brienne to kill the Kingslayer, and Brienne won't do it.

I think Brienne might choose instead to kill LSH. It mirrors Jaime killing the Mad King, and it brings her and Jaime's story to a nice full circle.

But that's what the post I linked to says. Why am I posting? Well, because I think it takes one darker turn. See, Jaime's killing of Aerys involved him breaking one oath to save innocents, and Brienne may kill LSH to do the same. Hell, she may try to prevent the Red Wedding 2.0 this way. But what would the consequences of that action be?

I think it'll be similar to what happened to Jaime. Brienne will be tarred an oathbreaker. She did swear a vow to Catelyn Stark, as everyone knows, and I'd bet she swore one to LSH too after getting not-hanged. We never do see what happened to Brienne after she shouted ""sword"". So Brienne will be considered an oathbreaker, like Jaime was. Even though she's as close to a true knight as we see in the books, even if she was *in the right*, everyone will think of her as a traitor, just like they do of the Kingslayer. She'll have forever given up her honor and her reputation to do what is right as word spreads that Brienne swore her sword to Catelyn Stark and broke her vow.

For that to happen to Brienne... that's *dark*. Brienne, one of the few truly righteous characters in ASOIAF being forever reviled like Jaime was? Her honor forever called into question, her name spat on... damn, that hurts. But that might also be interesting, I think.

So what happens next? My tinfoily guess is that the ""oathbreakers"", Jaime and Brienne, take control of the BwB. The user u/hollowaydivision wrote a [convincing post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6fmfns/spoilers_extended_the_smiling_lion_outlaw_country/)
as to Jaime and Brienne as leaders of the BwB that I believe. A new King Aegon will definitely want to rid Westeros of the Kingslayer, and will probably want to seem anti-red wedding. Perhaps word spreads that Jaime and Brienne killed unCat and saved the Freys? I could see TWOW ending with Jaime and Brienne learning that Aegon has declared them Oathbreakers and sent the Darkstar after them, like Arthur Dayne after the smiling knight.

After that, here's some tinfoil: Arya kills the Freys. Jaime and Brienne save the Freys from the Red Wedding 2.0 only to find them all dead in some castle with *The North Remembers* written in blood on the walls.

Having said that there are a lot of interesting pieces of information that could lead you to believe Aurane Waters will definitely betray Cersei or that he will stay loyal.

House Velaryon was a noble (non-dragonlord) house descended from Valyria, they were the Targaryens closest allies since before the conquest.  House Velaryon was repeatedly referred to as the 2nd house in the realm, at the pre-dance height of Targaryen Power they controlled an island with 2 castles, 2 towns and a shipyard to go along with their massive fleet of ships.  They had power wealth and position.  They had more wealth and prestige than House Lannister, House Hightower, etc.. 

By the time the main series begins they are an afterthought, one house amongst dozens of minor houses.

This would lead me to believe they would do anything to restore the Targaryen Dynasty and restore House Velaryon to its former glory.  Additionally the Targaryens married several Velaryons so there is a family/blood reason to restore them the Targaryens to power.

However two central figures in F&amp;B were Adam and Alyn Velaryon.  Two legitimized Velaryon bastards (Aurane Waters is not legitimaized I know)who proved above all else that they were brave, capable and most importantly LOYAL.

You could interpret this to mean that Aurane will mirror his bastard ancestors and stay loyal to the crown (the crown thinks Aurane has betrayed them, just like Rhaenyra and Adam).  Or you could think the opposite that Aurane and House Velaryon will stay loyal to House Targaryen and Aurane will use his stolen fleet to aid either Dany of (f)Aegon.

The theme of loyal bastards in House Velaryon plus the absurd amount of power and position they lost once the Targaryens went down open up many possibilities for what Aurane will do in TWoW.

On the one hand, he has Targaryen blood, which I don’t know what the point of that would be if isn’t leading towards him being in a ruling position of some kind.

Additionally, the trajectory of his plot and some of his foreshadowing suggest he’s being groomed into becoming a good leader and an effective ruler, like his time as lord commander and his desire to be Lord of Winterfell.

Mentally, he’ll be better off than Catelyn or Beric, but physically, he’ll likely have no need to eat, sleep, and will be unable to reproduce. It seems like his main purpose will be served resolving things with the Others, since his undead state makes him the perfect candidate for traveling into the land of always winter, and his Stark status may be important here as well.

Additionally, I find it likely that the end of ASOIAF will parallel the beginning, in that all signs of magic will have disappeared from the world, and the events of the main series will be remembered the same way the Age of Heroes is remembered by the main characters.

I believe Jon climbed The Wall between Stonedoor and Greyguard, so on the way back is the Nightfort.. 

It kind of makes sense to me that Ghost might have gone and protected Sam &amp; Gilly or/then Bran and his party at least temporarily, is there any evidence in the text to back that up? (I suppose I will need to reread)

Another question perhaps is why did Ghost return at all? would he have been more use protecting Bran? I know him returning helped make Jons mind up about not taking Stannis offer, also he is likely going to be a home for Jon's spirit at least temporarily. 

Any thoughts or evidence on the above would be interesting, thanks. 

ps. I guess another interesting thing to think about is, if Ghost had returned sooner before Janos Slynt arrived, Ghost would have been in bed with Jon when they came to drag him out of bed.. would that have led to Ghost defending Jon and potentially being killed? or killing the men and getting Jon a 100% death sentence? if not would Janos had ordered the Wolf to be killed anyway when Jon was put in an ice cell because they think Jon is a warg?

0,1,0,36,39,"The Nightfort is my contender for most intriguing building in Westeros. It’s the oldest castle of the Night’s Watch, dating from at least the 13th Lord Commander and likely dating back to the inception of the Watch. It has a passage guarded by a talking weirwood tree door. It comes from a time when the Others were the pressing issue for the Watch, not Wildings. And it has 500 ice cells. 500! I doubt the Watch had enough food to support 500+ prisoners, not right after the long winter and not when they could simply banish undesirables to the other side of the wall. And why would they want hundreds of prisoners locked up when they could be put to work on the wall? So why even build 500 cells?

I don’t know exactly, but I don’t think they were all for holding men. Not live ones, anyway.

Could these cages be for wights?

Jon had a similar thought, locking up the corpses at Castle Black and having them watched. He wanted to see what happened. I think the Nightfort’s experiments were even more advanced.

I don’t have a more exact guess than that, but I think the original Watch was up to something with these cells, and that the legends of the Night’s King aren’t even remotely accurate. I also speculate that the Nightfort’s new owner is going to stumble across something very important in TWOW. And in case anyone has forgotten, the new owner of the Nightfort is *Stannis*.

I am reading the books again and watching reruns of the show to prepare for the final season, and from all that I have seen and read, incest is generally portrayed negatively in particular with Jaime/Cersei and the Targaryen dynasty that was obsessed with keeping their bloodline pure. So to end the show with our heroes continuing a particularly disgusting tradition when they are supposed to “break the wheel” seems disingenuous to me, as they would just be preserving some of the worst aspects of the Targaryen dynasty. Incest with direct relatives is chief among them. Some people will use the argument that it happened in history, and it did, but the argument doesn’t fly here given the consistent portrayal of it as bad in both books and show. 

Also, Jon Snow is by far one of the most moral and “normal” characters in this series. To have him participate in incest even after discovering Daenerys is his aunt seems like a betrayal to his characterization. With Daenerys? Not so much since she was raised a Targaryen and therefore raised to think it is perfectly normal to marry your brother and other close relatives. I also don’t find her to be anywhere close to as moral as Jon Snow. I still like her, but her character is an embodiment of entitlement. 

The series ending with Jonerys as great love and a perfect Targaryen incest baby born and destined for the throne reads like some of the worst fanfiction I have read. Honestly.

But Jonsa shippers actually want them to get romantic.

3. Rickon in AGOT has the same dream as Bran - the dream that their father is in the crypts. When they find out that Ned is dead, its clear that they both dreamt of the future in some way. So does that mean that Rickon is a greenseer too or was it just a one time occasion?

Ok so this post is long and has lots of details regarding the prophecy of the Azor Ahai or The Prince that was Promised, so if you are educated on the subject, feel free to skim.

Jon kills tyrion for conspiring with Cercei and Dany as a mercy death and then will use the dragons to destroy the white walkers. Therefore forging his sword in the heart of a lion, forging his sword in the heart of his lover, then wielding light bringer (dragons) to defeat the darkness (white walkers.)

For this to be true, first you must know a few things about the shows history. For those who don't know, the prophecy states that the prince that was promised (TPTWP) tempered his sword in both the water and the heart of a lion and the sword snapped both times. It was then with great sorrow he knew that he must temper his sword in the heart of his lover Nissa Nissa. After doing so, it says that her blood, soul, strength, and courage went into the steel and the sword became lightbringer the red sword of heroes. TPTWP then used the sword to fight off the darkness, as far as the legend goes.

It is then foretold that Azor Ahai will come again. He/She must be born under a bleeding star, be reborn amidst salt and smoke, will wield a fiery weapon (possibly lightbringer), wake sleeping dragons from stone, and according to the woods witch, must be born of Rhaella and Aerys' bloodline. There are several theories surrounding which character will be the second coming of the Azor Ahai. This ranges anywhere from Sam Tarly, to Euron Greyjoy, however the most popular characters are Jon Snow and Dany. Reason being is that in one way or another, they consistently fit every description of the prophecy.

We'll first go into how Dany could be TPTWP. First Dany was born on dragon stone, which if she is TPTWP, that would count as being reborn, and dragon stone fits the credentials as being next to the ocean (salt) and being the original seat of house Targaryen (smoke). Dany was also reborn in season one when she walks out of the dead Khal's pyre with her freshly hatched dragons. Due to how broad the text is in the prophecy, it is believed that specifications can be met at both the true birth of the character, as well as if and when they are reborn. Therefore it is in this moment of walking out of the Pyre, that she has fulfilled several details of the prophecy at once. She is reborn amidst both smoke (from the flames), under a red shooting star that shoots across the sky (bleeding star), and wakes dragons out of stone. This scene, paired with her being originally born on Dragonstone, covers 4 of the details that will fulfill this prophecy. She was also born of Rhaella and Aerys' bloodline, and to solidify the argument, Maester Aemon goes as far as to say that for all these years maesters and followers of the R'hllor (worshipers of the Lord of Light, aka Melisandre and other Red Priestesses) have been fixated on the word prince, therefor looking for a male. Yet, due to the translation from High Valyrian, and how dragons have no true gender, that the translation could have meant prince or princess that was promised, therefore giving Dany another edge to the claim of TPTWP.

However I believe that Jon has the stronger claim to TPTWP. Well start with Jon's true birth and as to how he was born under the bleeding star. For those who know, there is a special sword named Dawn from House Dayne, that gets passed down to the most worthy Knight in the family, and then that knight will bear the title of the Sword of the Morning. What's special about this sword, is that it was forged from metal from a falling star, and is said to be on par with Valyrian. During Robert's Rebellion, it was Sir Arthur Dayne that wielded Dawn, and was ordered by Rhaegar Targaryen to guard Lyanna in the Tower of Joy. As most of you know, Lyanna gave birth to Jon in the tower, and Sir Dayne was there to protect her, but dies in battle by Howland Reed and Ned Stark. After his Dayne's death, Ned picks up the bloody Dawn and rushes up the tower where he sets the bloody dawn propped against the bed. Therefore Jon was literally born under a 'bleeding star'. As far as salt goes, it is said that lyanna's tears in childbirth, can be said to resemble being born of salt. Later on in season 6 we see Jon get resurrected by the red priestess Melisandre. It can be said here that he was reborn of smoke due to the fire in the room, as well as having a priestess of the lord of light cut off his hair and throw it in the flames. As far as the book goes, it is said that bran the builder felt a drop from the wall when it was being built, and as it melted down to his tongue he states that it felt ""warm and salty."" it is then theorized that due to its geological location of being near the ocean, and due to the lower melting point of salt, that the wall could have been frozen from salt water. This seems like a stronger case compared to that of lyanna's tears. Therefore we now have the bleeding star, salt and smoke. Then, jon is also of the same bloodline as dany, which would make him born of Rhaella and Aerys' bloodline as well.

What finally sets Jon apart from Dany is something that Dany actually experiences in season 2 at the house of the undying. Dany has many visions, however one important vision from the books is left out of the show. In the books Dany sees a room with a man with silver hair (presumably Rhaegar) who says to another woman in the room nursing a baby ""Aegon...What better name for a king…He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire""

For a while, this vision was taken rather literally as an actual event that took place between Rhaegar and Ellia Martell about their second child who was in fact named Aegon. However, like most of the visions, this was to be taken figuratively not literally. When converted to a metaphor, it is more likely that Rhaegar is actually speaking with Lyanna who is in fact nursing Jon. What makes this stand out, is that we find out in season seven that Lyanna actually named Jon Aegon as well. Now, due to jon being born from Lyanna of house Stark (Ice) and of house Targaryen (Fire), Jon is the only character in the realm to which the song of ice and fire could be associated to. (this is also what the entire series is called lol)

Now at this point, Dany and Jon share the same specifications that would allow both of them to fulfill the prophecy. This is where my theory takes over. Now that both Dany and Jon have fulfilled thus far, all that is left is to complete the prophecy: forge lightbringer. With the majority of fans agreeing that most of the prophecies have been fulfilled through metaphor, its not out of the question that the next part would require metaphors as well. This is where it gets cool.

So towards the end of season 7, tyrion must speak with cercei after Jon informs her that he has chosen to recognize Dany as his queen. It is generally believed that we only see the majority of their conversation, before it cuts to the rest of the characters back at the dragon pit. It's believed that whatever left of the conversation that takes place off screen, Tyrion and Cercei strikes a deal that requires Tyrion to betray Dany, Jon, and the rest of the cast.

At some point near the end of season 8 Jon will find out and will kill Tyrion, therefore forging his sword in the heart of a lion. Then, during the battle, or possibly during childbirth, Dany will become fatally wounded, and Jon will be forced to take her life as mercy to give her a quick death, therefore forging his sword in the heart of his lover. Dany's blood, soul, strength, and courage will then envelope the sword and give him and it the power of lightbringer to destroy the army of the dead, OR due to the dragons mother dying, and jon now being the last living Targaryen, he will now be in control of the dragons and he will use them to fight off the Knight King.

&gt;Abu Bakr II (fl. 14th century), also spelled Abubakri and known as Mansa Qu, may have been the ninth mansa of the Mali Empire. He succeeded his nephew Mansa Mohammed ibn Gao and preceded Mansa Musa. **Abu Bakr II abdicated his throne in order to explore ""the limits of the ocean"".**

&gt;The Arab-Egyptian scholar Al-Umari[1] quotes Mansa Musa as follows:

&gt;The ruler who preceded me did not believe that it was impossible to reach the extremity of the ocean that encircles the earth (meaning Atlantic), and wanted to reach that (end) and obstinately persisted in the design. So he equipped two hundred boats full of men, as many others full of gold, water and victuals sufficient enough for several years. He ordered the chief (admiral) not to return until they had reached the extremity of the ocean, or if they had exhausted the provisions and the water. They set out. Their absence extended over a long period, and, at last, only one boat returned. On our questioning, the captain said: 'Prince, we have navigated for a long time, until we saw in the midst of the ocean as if a big river was flowing violently. My boat was the last one; others were ahead of me. As soon as any of them reached this place, it drowned in the whirlpool and never came out. I sailed backwards to escape this current.' But the Sultan would not believe him. **He ordered two thousand boats to be equipped for him and for his men, and one thousand more for water and victuals. Then he conferred on me the regency during his absence, and departed with his men on the ocean trip, never to return nor to give a sign of life.[6]**

Little finger would have very in depth knowledge of Cersei's  (mind numbingly dumb) plan to rid herself of the Tyrells.

Remember that singer Marillion? After Petyr framed him for the death of Lysa, he mentions that he has a deal with Marillion. Marillion later confesses to a crime that he did not commit and is confined to a sky cell where be passes the time by singing. Later, it is said that Marillion ""walked in to the sky."" But Robert Arryn says that he can still hear singing at night. Even though the kid is a nut, it could be a hint that Marillion is still alive through this ""deal"" Petyr has with him. 


Later in AFFC, we meet the blue bard who is tortured by cersei and Qyburn and confesses to singing for Margaery while her cousins pleasured other men. Is it possible that the blue bard is actually Marillion? Did little finger send him to kings landing to play Cersei's game and lead her in to a trap? 

If little finger is behind all of this and everything worked out perfectly, he could rid himself of cersei and divide the Tyrells from the lannisters which is proving to be an unstoppable force in westeros.

Little finger is the last person anyone would expect to betray the Tyrells because it was him that United them to the lannisters in the first place back in ACOK. Little finger even says that he does things without motives to keep his enemies confused. 

The deal Petyr made with Marillion was his life in exchange for going to kings landing and taking a new name, with a new life's story, and dying his hair and never speaking of the Eyrie again.

These books contain a great many inconsistencies, and unless we want to accept that the books are badly written, we must infer things that aren't explicitly stated in the text in order to make it all add up. These inferences will either be **plot points** or **character traits**. (Or both.)

This might mark the fault line in the fandom between those who tinfoil and those who don't: the former have a tendency to explain away these inconsistencies with convoluted plotting, the latter with rich characterisation, neither of which is actually on the page.

Meanwhile, the former might be more likely to take the characters at face value, the latter, the plot.

I would emphasise the word ""tendency"", because of course these books have a relatively convoluted plot no matter which camp you fall into, and a lot of outlandish theories hinge on characters having hidden depths. But broadly speaking, people seem to be drawn to one of these two poles.

It tracks pretty well with my experience arguing with people around here, and I think it holds true for the analyses people make. Compare, say, [PoorQuentyn](http://poorquentyn.tumblr.com/) to [Preston Jacobs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXU7XVK_2Wd6tAHYO8g9vAA). The question everybody has about Quentyn Martell's chapters is ""What was the point of that shit, then?"", and these two both have very different yet equally convoluted answers. PJ doesn't think Quentyn's motives and personal history need too much [explicating](http://poorquentyn.tumblr.com/tagged/quentyn-in-adwd/chrono) because there's more story to be told. Meanwhile, PQ finds his namesake terribly interesting, and considers his chapters to be a rich tapestry unrivalled in all of literature - but he doesn't think [he's alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF7dbXuGTJY&amp;list=PLCsx_OFEYH6uvfZSfec35DXBEpvA9fpm0&amp;index=9).

And please, people: let's not get bogged down in whether or not Quentyn's really dead, or why the people who think so are wrong. The point I'm trying to make is that **the depth plumbed analysing character is often inversely proportional to the assumed complexity of the plot**.

Sticking with these two for simplicity's sake, we see the pattern holds on other topics. [PQ's cares about](http://poorquentyn.tumblr.com/tagged/davos-in-adwd/chrono) Davos's grief and guilt, PJ reads the same seemingly pointless chapters and uncovers a scheme of the Iron Bank's. (If anybody remembers which video that was, please let me know and I'll add the link here.) Reverse it, and the trend holds: PQ's [big theory](http://poorquentyn.tumblr.com/tagged/eldritch-apocalypse) is considerably more grounded and simpler than PJ's stuff, whereas in PJ's estimation, Rhaegar's motivation in pounding Lyanna was strictly prophetic and genetic. (Again, I'd like to add a link if anybody has it.)

I dare say this pattern will more or less hold for everybody: **simple plot with complex characters, or complex plot with simpler characters. (Relatively speaking.)**

---------------------------

You might even test yourself:

Consider Doran Martell. He seems firmly opposed to war and vengeance; he laments the prospect of children dying; he goes to great lengths to keep his own children safe. And yet, he sends both of his children into warzones to cosy up to invaders, with basically zero protection. How do you resolve these inconsistencies?

A. Doran is a multifaceted character whose peaceable and loving nature is in conflict with his hatreds and thirst for vengeance. His failure to resolve this conflict leads to tragic consequences, showing us how revenge poisons first the soul and then the world.

B. It don't make no sense: he must be up to something. Maybe they aren't really his children? That sneaky bastard...

Do you lean towards one or the other?

Feel free to formulate your own version in the comments.

There is of course a third group which accepts, probably correctly, that the seeming inconsistencies are really... inconsistencies. I suppose our two warring tribes can at least be united in hoping that this doesn't turn out to be the case.

And that's the point: pro-RLJ, anti-RLJ; tinfoil miners, tinfoil deniers - sometimes it seems like we can't get along, but really we've all got far more in common that not.

0,1,0,97,24,"There is a conflicting information in the books about whether Tywin did order to kill Elia or not. Tywin claims that he didn't:

&gt;""I grant you, it was done too brutally. Elia need not have been harmed at all, that was sheer folly. By herself she was nothing.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Then why did the Mountain kill her?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Because I did not tell him to spare her. I doubt I mentioned her at all. I had more pressing concerns. Ned Stark's van was rushing south from the Trident, and I feared it might come to swords between us. And it was in Aerys to murder Jaime, with no more cause than spite. That was the thing I feared most. That, and what Jaime himself might do.""

Oberyn, though, was of different opinion:

&gt;""Well, Prince Rhaegar married Elia of Dorne, not Cersei Lannister of Casterly Rock. So it would seem your mother won that tilt.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""She thought so,"" Prince Oberyn agreed, ""but your father is not a man to forget such slights. He taught that lesson to Lord and Lady Tarbeck once, and to the Reynes of Castamere. And at King's Landing, he taught it to my sister.

Tywin is a well known for his brutality, tendency to avenge any slights and for being an all around asshole. Considering what he did to Tysha and how he used Gregor in the Wot5K, it's tempting to believe Oberyn's version here and dismiss Tywin's explanation, yet for me Oberyn's version seems way too far-fetched to make sense.

First of all, when Tywin tells his version of events, he doesn't exactly try to make himself look clean in front of Tyrion. He flat out tells him that he ordered the deaths of Aegon and Rhaenys:

&gt;""We had come late to Robert's cause. It was necessary to demonstrate our loyalty. When I laid those bodies before the throne, no man could doubt that we had forsaken House Targaryen forever. And Robert's relief was palpable. As stupid as he was, even he knew that Rhaegar's children had to die if his throne was ever to be secure. Yet he saw himself as a hero, and heroes do not kill children.""

He does not tell him the version of events he wants Martells to hear:

&gt;""Ser Amory acted on his own in the hope of winning favor from the new king. Robert's hatred for Rhaegar was scarcely a secret.""

The fact that Tywin ordered it is supposed to be a secret and here he fully confesses the murders to Tyrion. Yet, he denies the order of killing Elia. Why, if he actually did it? What's the purpose of confessing to killing small children but not a grown woman? I suppose it could be to hide his pettiness from Tyrion who could have seen that killing Elia was completely unnecessary? But why would he care? Why tell Tyrion anything at all if that's the case?

Secondly, the whole motivation of Tywin is flimsy at best. Oberyn's idea is that Tywin was still supposedly slighted that Elia married Rhaegar and not Cersei. But Tywin surely understood that it was never Elia's decision but that of Aerys and Elia's parents, Elia had no say in it.

Okay, Oberyin might say that Tywin is just that petty. Still, at the point of Robert Rebellion, Tywin still being slighted over it makes no sense. He shouldn't have been slighted, he should have been *relieved.* At that point he personally hated Aerys due to everything Aerys did to him. He personally refused to serve him as his Hand at some point. And when the war broke out, Tywin refused to help him, even though if Lannisters fought for Targaryens, the rebels basically would have had no chance. He preferred to wait out who would win instead, after which he promptly joined the rebel cause and ordered to kill small Targaryen children. Tywin clearly had no love for Targaryens at that point. But imagine what a disaster would it be for him if in addition to Jaime, also Cersei would have been in KL, as a wife of Rhaegar, probably with Rhaeghar's children? Tywin would had been forced to side with his hated former friend because he would have at least 2 Lannister hostages instead of one, meaning if Tywin didn't come, the Mad King could have executed one (for example, Jaime), and still have leverage over him. It would be a much bigger headache for Tywin than he already had with just Jaime being in KL. So why would Tywin be still slighted over the fact that Elia was chosen over Cersei at that point?

It simply makes no sense. Is Tywin petty? Yes. But is he *that* petty, to the point that it becomes comical and just plain crazy? He just isn't. When he destroyed Tarbecks, he did spare everyone who wasn't a Tarbeck and wasn't resisting. After Wot5K, he did spare everyone who surrendered. This quote "" *When your enemies defy you, you must serve them steel and fire. When they go to their knees, however, you must help them back to their feet. Elsewise no man will ever bend the knee to you.*"" doesn't exactly come from an insanely petty person to the point of extreme as well. He also understood that Elia's murder would greatly slight Martells and make them his enemies for no reason, something he would try to fix later in the books.

Do I believe that Tywin was an asshole? Absolutely. But just being an asshole doesn't mean he absolutely had to order Elia's death and the motivation for it is just too unbelievable for me.

Another argument can be made that why would Tywin then send the monster Gregor to do the deed. Tywin claims he didn't yet fully understand what he was (he clearly knew he wasn't a saint since he did send him to kill the children according to Tywin himself). It can't really be said if it's true or not but I, again, believe Tywin purely because of what I wrote before, that the very fact that he would personally want to have Elia get killed makes little sense to me.

Have you ever look at hadrian's wall (what the book, show's wall is based on) and realised there are actually two walls? North and south?   I think the teaser was a give away where ice met fire. I think the original wall was in the neck and it was made of the oily black stone mentioned throughout the book (dragon glass).   


I think the pact gave the white walkers the north, you know... Where it's cold as fuck. Wight harbour, Barrowton. Literally towns of the dead. :D    


The original wall in the neck was smashed and the neck turned into swamp because there were 'magic spells cast into its foundations', that's why the marshes are magical and can hide entire towns and starks always melt when they go south.   


People steal bits of hadrians wall all the time and it would be amusing if over the thousands of years the wall was lost or destroyed because of thievery. The oily black stone appears all over the place. What if it was knocked down and sold :)    


I think The building of haranhal was an echo of the building of the dragonglass wall and the destruction of it. The NK taking down the ice wall is also an echo of it.   


This theory makes men the baddies for taking the north and breaking the pact. Bran the breaker anyone. Why would you use ice to keep out the WWs? I think it's also why the falling of the wall was given 5 mins at the end of season 7. It's not what we thought it was. There are many references in the books about the ice wall being built over generations.

0,1,0,32,60,"At this point in the story, the Elephant may be successfully en route to Lys with a cargo of female wildlings as slaves.  I have a hope for what will happen...


To recap its story: a woods witch led a large group of wildlings to Hardhome, promising that ships would come to take them someplace warm.  At Hardhome, they found two Lyseni ships, the Elephant and the Goodheart.  The Lyseni only had room for a small part of the wildling group, so they took the women and (mostly female) children.  Once they were away from shore, they chained the wildlings and put them in the hold to be sold as sex slaves in Lys.  There was a storm that separated the two ships, and the Goodheart ended up becoming so damaged it had to put in at Braavos, where slavery isn't allowed.  While in Braavos, Arya hears that the Elephant may be successfully en route to Lys.


It's been speculated that the Elephant will arrive in Lys and cause the Lyseni to send more ships to save/enslave everyone else at Hardhome; I respectfully disagree.  I think the remaining wildlings will be saved by Braavosi ships, if they're saved at all.  Braavos is closer, and obviously the news of the wildlings' plight has already gotten there.  Braavos was founded by people running from slavery, and slavery is abhorrent to them.  The people of Braavos will most certainly take on these refugees, if they get there in time to save them from the Others.  It's entirely possible, though, that their ships find Hardhome to be a ghost town, or worse, filled with wights.


It is my hope that the Elephant's story is going a different direction.  I hope the Elephant is setting up a new slave insurrection in the pillowhouses of Lys.  Think about it: wildling women will NOT make good pillowhouse sex slaves.  Their tradition is that lovers ""steal"" one another, and the women are traditionally expected to defend themselves using any means necessary.  Ygritte makes it pretty clear that she would cut the throat of any man she didn't like who tried to steal her.  Val casually suggests that she'll cut off the manhood of anyone who tries to steal her against her will.  These are the type of women the Elephant is bringing to the pillowhouses of Lys.


Once they get there, they could very easily change the entire power structure of the city and create their own organization akin to the Faceless Men - the Lyseni Free Women.  What do you think?",1,What I hope happens with the female wildlings on the Elephant: (Spoilers Extended),2403,82

0,1,0,31,68,"**Warning**: this post is a little long, and a TL;DR will be provided at the end.  

Instead of studying for exams. I was flipping through AGOT and I re-read the Prologue, and then Eddard X.  For those who do not remember, this is the chapter in which Ned has the Tower of Joy dream.  My reason for reading this chapter in particular is that Ned's memory/dream of the fight is one of the most memorable moments in the entire series.  This time around, I tried to pay closer attention.  This quote really struck me:

&gt;""And now it begins,"" said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. **The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light**. (AGOT Eddard X)

First, I thought this was an interesting way to describe Dawn.  We all can picture Dawn, the giant greatsword that Arthur wields as the Sword of the Morning, being the general badass he was pre-death.  But the line that struck me was ""*alive with light*.""  This was definitely something I had read to describe something else, and thinking back on the Prologue I had read before this, I looked to the quote from Will's description of the Other that fights Waymar Royce:

&gt;The Other slid forward on silent feet. In its hand was a longsword like none that Will had ever seen. No **human metal** had gone into the forging of that blade. It was **alive with moonlight**, translucent, a shard of crystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when seen edge-on. There was a faint blue shimmer to the thing, a ghost-light that played around its edges, and somehow Will knew it was sharper than any razor. (AGOT, Prologue)

Here again, we see almost exactly the same description of a sword, this time the one wielded by the Other that fights Ser Waymar.  

*(For the record, I did do a preliminary search trying to see if anyone had noticed this potential connection before.  If I missed your post and I am not the one to notice this, I apologize.)*

The first thing I thought was that Will might not be familiar with Valyrian steel, and he did not recognize it.  However, as Will is our observer here, we can assume he probably has seen Longclaw, the Valyrian steel weapon that, at this time, belonged to the Old Bear Jeor Mormont.  And besides, we can generally rule out Valyrian steel for either Dawn or the Other's sword, because Dawn is described as being something different, and dragonsteel (or Valyrian steel) supposedly is the weapon of choice to defeat the Others.  Recall Sam's discussion with Jon:

&gt;""I found one account of the Long Night that spoke of the last hero slaying Others with a blade of **dragonsteel**. **Supposedly they could not stand against it**."" (AFFC, Samwell I)

So it makes sense that the Others definitely do not use Valyrian steel.  As for Dawn, it's origins are murky.  I went looking for more description of Dawn, to try to really get a better understanding of the connection forming in my head.  Credit to /u/mrdziuban's ""A Search of Ice and Fire"" which is incredibly helpful.  Here is the next mention of Dawn in the series:

&gt;""The finest knight I ever saw was Ser Arthur Dayne, who fought with a blade called **Dawn, forged from the heart of a fallen star**. They called him the Sword of the Morning, and he would have killed me but for Howland Reed."" Father had gotten sad then, and he would say no more. Bran wished he had asked him what he meant. (ACOK, Bran III)

OK, so here we have our first real description of what Dawn is, besides the fact that it is an incredibly badass sword.  Ned, who had known the Dayne family, met Arthur and Ashara, and visited and stayed with them at Starfall for a period of time, says that Dawn was forged from a shooting star.  This gives us confirmation, from Ned, that Dawn is not Valyrian steel.  The next mention of Dawn is no real help, but we will recall it here just because this exchange is badass:

&gt;And Dayne, with Dawn in hand . . . The outlaw's longsword had so many notches by the end that Ser Arthur had stopped to let him fetch a new one. **""It's that white sword of yours I want,"" the robber knight told him as they resumed, though he was bleeding from a dozen wounds by then. ""Then you shall have it, ser,""** the Sword of the Morning replied, and made an end of it. (ASOS, Jaime VIII)

Again, no real help but perhaps it is important to note that Jaime, Arthur, and the Smiling Knight all really think of Dawn as a special weapon.  In fact, nearly everyone who speaks of Dawn touts it as the best weapon in the Seven Kingdoms, including [George R. R. Martin himself.](https://www.quora.com/Who-would-win-in-a-fight-between-Ser-Barristan-Selmy-and-Ser-Arthur-Dayne)  The history of Dawn, as told to us by Ned and by legends, is that it was forged by a fallen star.  The next mention comes in a Dunk &amp; Egg tale, mentioned briefly with no new relevant information.  Dawn is also mentioned in TWOIAF, and here finally we get some more information:

&gt;The Daynes of Starfall are one of the most ancient houses in the Seven Kingdoms, though their fame largely rests on their ancestral sword, called Dawn, and the men who wielded it. **Its origins are lost to legend, but it seems likely that the Daynes have carried it for thousands of years.** Those who have had the honor of examining **it say it looks like no Valyrian steel they know**, being pale as milkglass but in all other respects it seems to share the properties of Valyrian blades, being incredibly strong and sharp.  
&gt;  
&gt;Though many houses have their heirloom swords, they mostly pass the blades down from lord to lord. Some, such as the Corbrays have done, may lend the blade to a son or brother for his lifetime, only to have it return to the lord. But that is not the way of House Dayne. The wielder of Dawn is always given the title of Sword of the Morning, **and only a knight of House Dayne who is deemed worthy can carry i**t.   
&gt;  
&gt;Lord Stark then **returned Dawn to Starfall**, and to Ser Arthur's kin, as a sign of respect.  (TWOIAF, Dorne: The Andals Arrive)

In the world book, we get some more useful information about Dawn.  (For the record, the quotes in this post are the only instances in which Dawn is mentioned in the entire ASOIAF collection).  The Daynes have carried it for thousands of years, which could be important because it has held up all this time.  We also get confirmation that backs up Ned's observations, which is that Dawn is different than Valyrian steel, which could be important in regards to the theories I bring up at the end.  Only a worthy Dayne can carry it, which means Dawn was not likely used in the first Long Night (unless the Last Hero was a Dayne, which is possible but not likely).  One thing that remains unclear is the actual truth regarding the forging of the blade.  

I think it is possible that the Daynes did use the metal from a fallen star to forge their blade, but I will ask you to remember the description used for both Dawn and the blade the Other wields: *pale and alive with light*.

We do get one more mention of an Other who wields a similar blade:

&gt;The Other's sword **gleamed with a faint blue glow**. It moved toward Grenn, lightning quick, slashing. When the ice blue blade brushed the flames, a screech stabbed Sam's ears sharp as a needle.  (ASOS, Samwell I)

This time, Martin doesn't use the same language, but the gist is the same: **alive with light**.  While this seems like a weak connection, the only times a sword is mentioned as being ""**alive with light**"" are **the Other's sword** in the Prologue of AGOT, **and Arthur Dayne's Dawn** in Eddard X.  Think of how many times George describes swords; from Valyrian steel down to the worst swords.  Not once does he describe a sword like this but for those 2 specific, and probably ultimately important, swords.

Based on this connection, I think it's possible that Dawn was either a blade taken from an Other (this seems far-fetched), made from the same material as the blades of the Others (most possible of my three claims), or (perhaps most ludicrous of all) the Others copied the design of Dawn when constructing their blades for the second coming of the Long Night.  

Where would they have seen this blade before?  Well, if the Last Hero wielded Dawn (aka Lightbringer) the first time around, the Others may have wanted blades that match the quality of that sword.  This theory falls apart however, because earlier Sam tells us it was dragonsteel that reportedly defeated the Others last time, thus ruling out Dawn, the non-Valyrian sword.

I won't rule out my other two ideas just yet though.  I think it's possible we could find out that Dawn's origins are one of these options:

1. Taken from an Other during the original Long Night thousands of years ago
2. Forged from the same material as the swords of the Others (a fallen star?)
3. Neither of the two options, and I am just looking too deep into these descriptions

Either way, if you read this far thanks for taking the time to hear me out.  Even if this connection amounts to nothing, which is likely, it reinforces the benefits of re-reading the series, and maybe most frightening of all, reminds how desperately we need Winds to come out.

**TL;DR** 

**Dawn, the ancient blade of House Dayne, and the swords of the Others, are connected.  Martin describes both as being ""alive with light,"" which are the only times in the series a sword is described in this way.  My theory is that there is a connection between what Dawn is made of and what the swords of the Others are made of; either Dawn was stolen from an Other or Dawn is made from the same material as the swords of the Others (fallen stars perhaps?)**

In this post, I'll finally discuss the final proposition: that Tyene is the pock-marked, story novice in the Epilogue of ADWD. I'll then turn to a kind of appendix to the entire chapter, in which I discuss an absolutely jaw-dropping parallel GRRM has created between three picturesque journeys which tends to reinforce the conclusion that Quiet Isle's Elder Brother must surely be Lewyn Martell.

A decent chunk of this will still be of interest to those who have not read or do not buy (all) my other arguments. Still, while the primary focus will be on the storky novice and Tyene, some of the evidence for this circles back to and solidifies the argument I've been making that Tyene's great-uncle Lewyn is Quiet Isle's Elder Brother.

Away we go!

#Tyene Sand, the Stork Novice
I believe Tyene Sand has arrived in King's Landing and has infiltrated Cersei's inner sanctum as a novice of the Seven as of the Epilogue of ADWD. This fact, once realized, helps confirm that Lewyn Martell is Elder Brother of Quiet Isle, just as the idea that Lewyn is the Elder Brother supports the idea that Tyene is indeed one of the novices serving Cersei.

I'll begin by considering in isolation the hypothesis that Tyene is one of the novices attending Cersei.

##Sweet Otherworldly Innocence
We're told four times that Tyene is ""sweet"", twice that she's ""innocent"" and once of her ""otherworldly innocence"":
&gt;**Tyene is so sweet** and gentle that no man will suspect her. (FFC CotG)
***
&gt;[Tyene]… rose as they entered, dressed in a clinging gown… that made her look **as innocent as the Maid herself.** (CotG)
***
&gt;…she looked as **sweet** as summer strawberries.… **Tyene had an air of almost otherworldly innocence about her.** (CotG)
***
&gt;Tyene had always been the one she loved the most, though; the **sweet** sister that she never had. (PitT)
***
&gt;Lady Tyene smiled at that. Her gown was cream and green, with long lace sleeves, so modest and **so innocent that any man who looked at her might think her the most chaste of maids.** (DWD tW)
***
&gt;""Ser Gregor does look lonely,"" said Tyene, in her **sweet** septa's voice. (tW)

##""Child-Woman""
Critically, Hotah calls Tyene ""a child-woman""—
&gt;Tyene, blue-eyed and blond, **a child-woman** with her soft hands and little giggles. (DWD tW)

—which indicates she looks much younger than her ""three-and-twenty"" years. (FFC App) The term ""child-woman"" is used only one other time in the canon, when it refers to a 16-year-old:
&gt;**Lyanna had only been sixteen, a child-woman** of surpassing loveliness. (GOT E I)

##Cersei's Novices
With all that in mind, here's what Kevan's POV tells us of the novices serving Cersei at the end of ADWD:
&gt;**The meal was served by three novices, well-scrubbed girls of good birth between the ages of twelve and *sixteen*. In their soft white woolens, each seemed more innocent and unworldly than the last**, yet the High Septon had insisted that no girl spend more than seven days in the queen's service, lest Cersei corrupt her. They tended the queen's wardrobe, drew her bath, poured her wine, changed her bedclothes of a morning. One shared the queen's bed every night, to ascertain she had no other company; the other two slept in an adjoining chamber with the septa who looked over them.

&gt;**A tall stork of a girl with a pockmarked face** escorted him into the royal presence.

Cersei goes on to say of the novices:
&gt;""I am well served. **The girls are sweet**…""

The overlap is obvious: Tyene the ""child-woman"" is called ""sweet"" *four times*, and her ""almost otherworldly innocence"" comports with how the novices—who appear no more than 16-years-old to him, *like the child-woman Lyanna*—""each seemed more innocent and unworldly than the last"".

I submit that one of the novices is Tyene: specifically she is the ""tall stork of a girl"".

##""A Tall Stork Of A Girl"" Like Tyene
The structure of the phrase *""stork of a girl""* recalls the very first reference to Tyene's father Oberyn Martell in ASOIAF:
&gt;""That **snake of a Dornishman** was to blame, that Oberyn Martell."" (SOS San I)

Storks are known for being ""long-legged""/""having long legs""/""having very long legs""/""having long legs"". (wikipedia: stork; freedictionary.com; dictionary.com) Tyene being the ""tall stork of a girl"" thus makes sense. First, she is tall—
&gt;…the Sand Snakes were tall…

—which usually entails long legs. Second, she is Oberyn's daughter, and Oberyn's ""long strides"" imply long legs. Third, her being a ""child-woman"" is consistent with her have the gangly, long-legged frame of an adolescent. Fourth, her sister Nym is ""slender as a willow"", which is consistent with a leggy frame. Fifth, everyone buys the idea that Obara is her sister, and Obara is explicitly ""long-legged"". (FFC CotG; C II; SOS Ty X)

##Well-Scrubbed Sisters
Cersei's novices are called ""well-scrubbed"". It just so happens that Tyene's ""sister"" Arianne is *literally* just that:
&gt;Arianne found a basin and a flagon of cool water and washed her hands and face, but **no amount of scrubbing could cleanse her of her grief.** (FFC PitT)

##Nifty Ironies
The novices are said to be ""of good birth"", which becomes ironic if one of them is Tyene, who is both daughter to a prince (a good birth indeed!) and a bastard (not so much).

There are a couple broader ironies that suggest Tyene is the stork, as well. First, when Cersei schemes with Taena, she complains that Queen Margaery is always surrounded by her cousins, whom she calls…
&gt;""Wantons clad in maiden's white."" (FFC IX)

If I'm right, Tyene the novice is ironically *exactly that,* a ""wanton in maiden's white"": The novices wear ""soft white woolens"" while Dornishwomen like Tyene are tagged as ""wanton""—
&gt;In the Reach men said it was the food that made Dornishmen so hot-tempered and **their women so wild and wanton.** (tSK)

—as is Tyene's own half-sister Arianne, a ""willful wanton"". (ibid)

Second, we're oddly told that ""One [of the novices] shared the queen's bed every night"". That is, of course, *exactly* what *Taena* was doing until her disappearance. Thus if *Tyene* is the storky novice and one of Cersei's bedmates, this banal detail becomes ironic and amusing, both because of the near-homophones ""Tyene"" and ""Taena"", and because of something I will argue in the future: that Taena is one of Doran's moles at court, Oberyn's daughter and *Tyene's half-sister.*

##The Stalking Storks of Quiet Isle
The novice in question being ""a stork of a girl"" links her to the *literal* storks that ""stalked"" the ""path of faith"" leading to Elder Brother Lewyn Martell's Quiet Isle:
&gt;**Storks stalked** through the **tidal pools** and **left their footprints** all around them, and crabs scuttled across the surface of shallow waters. (FFC B VI)

Obviously if you already ""know"" that Elder Brother is Lewyn Martell, this ""coincidence"" tends to support the idea that the novice is Tyene. That said, the highlighted motifs work in a couple ways to help confirm that both Elder Brother and the storky novice are Martells.

First, Brienne's POV connects the tidal pools through which the ""storks stalked"" to *reeds*:
&gt;The road was prone to vanishing amongst the **reeds and tidal pools**… (FFC B V)

This repeats an association found when Arya surveys a similar landscape (and elsewhere):
&gt;A slow brown river entered the lagoon from the south, wandering through a wide expanse of **reeds, tidal pools**, and mudflats. (FFC Ar II)

Brienne's POV then connects said reeds to *willows*:
&gt;""Beauty,"" whispered **the willows** on the bank, but **the reeds** said, ""freak, freak."" (FFC B VII)

Again, this repeats an association made by Arya (and others, elsewhere) in a similar landscape:
&gt;There were a few **willows** growing along the river's edge and **reed beds** in the muddy shallows beyond, but most of the ground hereabouts was painfully open. (SOS A II)

The stalking storks' shallow tidal pools are thus linked to willows. So what? *So*, Tyene's sister Nymeria Sand is *""slender as a willow""*, which reminds us of…
&gt;""…a girl **as supple as a willow** with eyes like **deep blue pools**…"" (DWD Ty II)

…who was given to Hugor of the Hill *by the Maid*, to whom Hotah *explicitly likens Tyene* as he describes Tyene's eyes as textually identical *""deep blue pools""*:
&gt;[Tyene] rose as they entered, … **as innocent as the Maid herself. … [H]er eyes were deep blue pools**… (CotG)

Storks, reeds, willows, Tyene's sister, deep blue pools, the Maid, Tyene: the path of connections is right there. GRRM even makes up a couple battles—
&gt;The Battle of the **Reeds** was a Targaryen victory, but they suffered heavy losses at the Wailing **Willows**… (TWOIAF)

—to shore up the trickiest step. The Maid-like Tyene with her eyes like ""deep blue pools"" is the storky novice.

##*Stalking* Storks in Tidal *Pools*
It goes deeper still. The text calls out the pool-stalking storks' footprints in the mud—
&gt;**Storks stalked** through the tidal **pools** and **left their footprints** all around them… 

—a mere three sentences before it calls out Septon Meribald's footprints in the mud, which *act* like tidal pools:
&gt;His **footprints** filled up with water as soon as he moved on. (FFC B VI)

The storks are thus paralleled to a guy who *loves* oranges:
&gt;""I have a weakness for the orange, I confess."" - Meribald (FFC B V) 

As discussed earlier, the motifs of (a) *pools,* (b) *stalking,* and (c) *oranges* just so happen to coalesce when he meet *Tyene's sisters*:
&gt;""Dorea **stalks** about knocking **oranges** off the trees with her morningstar, and Elia and Obella have become the terror of **the pools**."" (FFC PitT)

As a grace note, the very first reference in ASOIAF to ""stalking"" like the Quiet Isle's storks stalk involves Arya's wolf ""Nymeria""—
&gt;Nymeria stalked closer on wary feet. (GOT A I)

—who was named after Nymeria of the Rhoynar, the founder of Elder Brother Lewyn's house for whom Tyene the Stalking Stork Novice's sister Nymeria was named.

##Bonifer Hasty and Tyene
Some will object that calling the novice a ""stork"" simply suggests she is kin to the pious Ser Bonifer Hasty, *""a solemn stork of a man"".* They are correct in one narrow sense: the link between the tall pockmarked ""stork of a girl"" novice and the ""stork of a man"" Ser Bonifer is an important one. But it's a metatextual clue, not a matter of in-world physiognomy. It entails Martell secrets I have yet to discuss, so you'll have to trust me when I say there is a wonderful reason to believe the novice is Tyene *precisely because* GRRM chose to have her resemble Ser Bonifer.

That said, I can at least note that calling Bonifer the stork ""solemn""—
&gt;…Ser Bonifer Hasty, **a solemn stork** of a man prone to **salting** his speech…. (FFC J III)

—reminds us of Quentyn, who is called solemn twice, while the idiom ""salting"" reminds us of the nominally ""salty Dornish"" Martells. (DWD Dae VII; WOW Ari II)

##The Pockmarks
Tyene the stork-y novice's pockmarks are a disguise. We know Arya's Blind Beth disguise uses ""pox scars"", which are the same thing as ""pockmarks"", given that Ilyn Payne is described alternately as ""pockmarked"" and ""pox-scarred."" (DWD tBG; COK San III, VI)

Nevertheless, they remind us of Margaery's septa, Nysterica, who has…
&gt;…a homely pox-scarred face but seemed jolly. (SOS San I)

This is intentional. The question is, *what's being connoted here?* The full answer for that will have to wait. If you're curious, feel free to read a teaser below.

##PS: Who Is Septa Nysterica?
Might Nysterica be Tyene's *mother*? Are Tyene's false pockmarks a kind of wink at their relationship? Nysterica certainly *seems* coded as having some kind of relationship with Dorne. The name Nysterica is somewhat reminscent of Nymeria. Septa ""Scolera"" has the ""olive skin"" of a Dornish woman, and her name contains the same E-R syllable and A ending. (DWD C I) A little shuffle gets us close to ""Nysterica"":

N|Y|S|T|E|R|I|C|A|||
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
**N** |**Y**|M||**E**|**R**|**I**||**A**|| 
 ||**S**||**E**|**R**||**C**|**A**|O|L
 ||**S**||**C**|O|L|**E**|**R**|**A**|

Is Nysterica therefore *Dornish?* Or is her name merely an allusion to her working for Doran, even if her lineage lies elsewhere? Is Nysterica one of Doran's ""friends at court… who tell us things we were not meant to know""? (DWD tW) 

Regardless of her personal lineage, *is she Tyene's septa mother?* Consider: Nysterica comes to King's Landing *from Highgarden*, whereas we're told that…
&gt;Arianne Martell had **crossed the Mander once**, when she had gone with three of the Sand Snakes **to visit Tyene's mother**… (FFC tQM)

…and that…
&gt;One Dornish king… **crossed the Mander and sacked Highgarden**… (TWOIAF)

…thereby suggesting that Arianne's visit was to Highgarden and thus that Tyene's mother lived there at the time. Our story *hammers* the notion of (verbatim) ""visiting"" Highgarden:
&gt;""Sansa, would you like to visit Highgarden?"" (SOS San I)
***
&gt;""Shush, child,"" the Queen of Thorns said sharply. ""Sansa hasn't even told us that she would like to come **for a visit.**"" (SOS San I)
***
&gt;Only yesterday he brought us word of a Tyrell plot to spirit Sansa Stark off **to Highgarden for a 'visit,'** and there marry her to Lord Mace's eldest son, Willas."" (SOS Ty III)
***
&gt;Lady Olenna smiled. ""I am pleased to say I shall be leaving for **Highgarden** the day after next. I have had quite enough of this smelly city, thank you. Perhaps you would like to accompany me **for a little visit**, whilst the men are off having their war? (SOS T VIII)

Surely, then, Arianne, Tyene et al. went to Highgarden when they ""crossed the Mander… to visit Tyene's mother"". The idea that they were visiting Nysterica gets a cute textual boost from the fact that Wendel and Wyman *Mander*ly—as in ""crossed the Mander""—are both called ""jolly"", like Nysterica. (COK B II; DWD PiW).

True, Doran and Hotah speak of Tyene's mother *having been* a septa, in the past tense—
&gt;""Your mother **was** a septa."" - Doran (DWD tW)
***
&gt;Her mother **had been** a septa, and Tyene had an air of almost otherworldly innocence about her. (iFFC CotG)

—but if Nysterica is undercover, perhaps she's no longer a ""true"" septa but rather maintaining a facade to gather information on Dorne's enemies, first in Highgarden, now in King's Landing.

Either way, Nysterica could very well be one of Doran's ""friends at court"". She is, after all, ""Queen Margaery's own septa"" and privy to many events at court. Could Nysterica's odd name connote this?

If Nysterica is Tyene's mother, perhaps her seeming identity is a red herring. *What ""seeming identity?* That of Alys Arryn's eldest surviving daughter, who was…
&gt;…terribly scarred by the same pox that killed her sisters, so she became a septa. (FFC Ala II)

Alys married Elys Waynwood, so it's a fair bet her septa daughter would be ""homely"" like Nysterica, since Sansa calls Rolland and Wallace Waynwood ""horse-faced and homely"" and Catelyn calls Donnel Waynwood ""homely"". (TWOW Ala I; GOT C VI) In-world, the name *Nys*terica could belong to the daughter of El*ys* and Al*ys*, especially because their son was De*nys*. While the Waynwoods are not called ""jolly"", they do laugh at Randa's joke, and Rolland…
&gt;…made [Sansa] laugh with mocking comments about half the other knights in the hall. His uncle Wallace took a turn as well and tried to do the same… (TWOW Ala I)

I admit I am being a bit disingenuous here: I know who Tyene's mother is. I have written reams about it, to be posted in the near future. Is it ""Nysterica""? We'll see.

***

That wraps up my discussion of Tyene being the storky novice, as well as the main body of the first ""chapter"" in my Secret History of House Martell. Before I move on to the second chapter and a whole new set of outrageous propositions, I want to kinda, sorta come back to the idea that Lewyn is Elder Brother one more time. This time, though, the pace will be a bit different and the focus less direct. This is a post full of loooong quotations which must be not just read but *savored*, turned over and caressed if it's going to make any sense. It's of general interest to anyone interested in GRRM's writing in general, even if you don't care about idea that Lewyn is Elder Brother. It's best enjoyed with a cup of something warm to drink… or perhaps a cold beer if you're in the southern hemisphere and it's considerably hotter than the -17 degrees celcius/1 degree farenheit I'm getting set to enjoy tomorrow.

#APPENDIX: Crab-Walkin': Overwhelmingly Parallel Nature Studies
While taking a look at the verbiage surrounding the Quiet Isle's suspicious storks, which I've argued hint (a) that Tyene is the pockmarked storky novice in ADWD's Epilogue and (b) that Quiet Isle's Elder Brother is her uncle Lewyn, a strange things happened. The words ""crabs scuttled""—
&gt;Storks stalked through the tidal pools and left their footprints all around them, and **crabs scuttled** across the surface of shallow waters. (FFC B VI)

—led me to discover a massive parallel between Brienne's Meribald-guided walk on the dangerous, twisting path of faith and Jon's Stonesnake-led climb up a dangerous, snaking path towards the wildling watchers… which eventually extended to Arianne's path through the rainwood as well (and beyond, although I won't talk about that here). These passages are long and I've highlighted lots of stuff, but a deliberate, careful comparative reading will prove eye-opening:
&gt;Jon knelt and let the direwolf nuzzle him before they set off. **""Stay,"" he commanded. ""I'll be back for you.""**

&gt;**Stonesnake took the lead.**… By day the mountains were **blue-grey**, brushed with frost, but once the sun vanished behind the jagged peaks they turned **black**. Now the rising moon had limned them in **white and silver**.

&gt;The **black** brothers moved through **black** shadows amidst **black** rocks, working their way up a steep, **twisting trail** as their breath frosted in the **black** air. Jon felt almost naked without his mail, but he did not miss its weight. This was hard going, and slow. **To hurry here was to risk a broken ankle or worse. Stonesnake seemed to know where to put his feet as if by instinct, but Jon needed to be more careful on the broken, uneven ground.**

&gt;The Skirling Pass was really a series of passes, **a long twisting course** that went **up around** a succession of icy wind-carved peaks **and down** through hidden valleys that seldom saw the sun. …Tumbled shelves of rock often overhung the trail, fringed with hanging icicles that looked like long **white** teeth from a distance.

&gt;Yet even so, Jon Snow was not sorry he had come. There were wonders here as well. He had seen **sunlight flashing on icy thin waterfalls** as they plunged over the lips of sheer stone cliffs, and a mountain meadow full of autumn wildflowers, **blue coldsnaps and bright scarlet frostfires and stands of piper's grass in russet and gold.** He had peered down **ravines so deep and black they seemed certain to end in some hell**, and he had ridden his garron over a wind-eaten bridge of natural stone with nothing but sky to either side. Eagles nested in the heights and came down to hunt the valleys, circling effortlessly on great **blue-grey wings** that seemed almost part of the sky. Once **he had watched a shadowcat *stalk* a ram**, flowing down the mountainside like liquid smoke until it was **ready to pounce**.

&gt;**Now it is our turn to pounce**. He wished he could move as sure and silent as that shadowcat, and kill as quickly. Longclaw was sheathed across his back, but he might not have room to use it. He carried dirk and dagger for closer work. They will have weapons as well, and I am not armored. **He wondered who would prove the shadowcat by night's end, and who the ram.**

&gt;**For a long way they stayed to the trail, following its twists and turns as it snaked** along the side of the mountain, upward, ever upward. **Sometimes the mountain folded back on itself and they lost sight of the fire**, but soon or late it would always reappear. **The path Stonesnake chose would never have served for the horses**. In places Jon had to put his back to the cold stone and **shuffle along sideways *like a crab*,** inch by inch. Even where the track widened **it was treacherous; there were cracks big enough to swallow a man's leg, rubble to stumble over**, hollow places where **the water pooled by day and froze hard by night.** One step and then another, Jon told himself. One step and then another, and I will not fall. (COK J VI)

Brienne's walk on the path of faith reworks a *ton* of these motifs, forming a wonderful rhyme to Jon's climb. We'll see that both vignettes manage to somehow feature:

- an obedient *canid* (Dog replacing Ghost)

- an explicitly dangerous, twisting path that doubles back away from its destination, requiring a guru-guide's lead to navigate it safely
- cyclical pools of water (tide pools vs. freezing/thawing pools)
- an explosion of color-focused natural beauty, including sunlight reflecting on water/ice
- pointed allusions to falling from the safety of the path into hell
- the explicit impossibility of riding horses
- of all things, a *crab's method of locomotion*.

Jon's stalking shadowcat is matched by Quiet Isle's stalking storks. Jon's doubts about ""who would prove the shadowcat… and who the ram"" and thoughts of the battle to come are reworked by Dog's battle with a crab.

The rest is patent, is you read carefully:
&gt;""If you would sleep beneath a roof tonight, **you must climb off your horses** and cross the mud with me. The path of faith, we call it. **Only the faithful may cross safely. The wicked are swallowed by the quicksands, or drowned when the tide comes rushing in.** None of you are wicked, I hope? Even so, **I would be careful where I set my feet. Walk only where I walk, and you shall reach the other side.""**

&gt;**The path of faith was a crooked one**, Brienne could not help but note. **Though the island seemed to rise to the northeast of where they left the shore, Septon Meribald did not make directly for it. Instead, he started due east**, toward the deeper waters of the bay, which **shimmered blue and silver** in the distance. The soft **brown** mud squished up between his toes. As he walked he paused from time to time, to probe ahead with his quarterstaff. **Dog stayed near his heels**, sniffing at every rock, shell, and clump of seaweed. **For once he did not bound ahead or stray.**

&gt;Brienne followed, taking care to keep close to the line of prints left by the dog, the donkey, and the holy man. Then came Podrick, and last of all Ser Hyle. **A hundred yards out, Meribald turned abruptly toward the south, so his back was almost to the septry.** He proceeded in that direction for another hundred yards, leading them between two shallow tidal pools. **Dog stuck his nose in one and yelped when a crab pinched it with his claw. A brief but furious struggle ensued before the dog came trotting back, wet and mud-spattered, with the crab between his jaws.** …

&gt;The flats shimmered wetly all about them, mottled in **half a hundred hues**. The mud was such a **dark brown** it appeared **almost black**, but there were swathes of **golden** sand as well, upthrust rocks both **grey and red**, and tangles of **black and green** seaweed. **Storks stalked** through the **tidal pools** and left their footprints all around them, and **crabs scuttled** across the surface of shallow waters. The air smelled of brine and rot, and the ground sucked at their feet and let them go only reluctantly, with a pop and a squelchy sigh. **Septon Meribald turned and turned again and yet again.** By the time the ground grew firmer and **began to rise** beneath the feet, they had walked at least a mile and a half. (FFC B VI)

There's even a nod to climbing at the end, for good measure.

What's the point of this connection? I believe it's all about encoding the fact that both these stories have a hidden connection to *Dorne* and the Martells. Setting aside the precise identity of Stonesnake, he ""smells Dornish"", to quote Aerys II. His contrived name, ""Stonesnake"", blatantly evokes Oberyn's ""Sand Snakes"" and Dorne. ""Stone"" replaces ""Sand"" a la ""stony"" versus ""sandy"" Dornishmen, while Cersei tells us…
&gt;All Dornishmen were snakes… (DWD C I)

Stonesnake's Dornish-ness is driven home by his exit:
&gt;…[Jon] watched Stonesnake vanish over a snow-covered ridge, **a tiny black bug crawling** across a rippling expanse of white.

Arya tells us ""scorpions"" are ""bugs""—
&gt;…atop their battlements the rows of wood-and-iron **scorpions looked as small as the bugs for which they were named.** (COK Ary VI)

—thus (a) further connecting Stonesnake with Quiet Isle's scuttling crabs (because crabs and scorpions are both arthropods) and (b) further suggesting that Stonesnake is Dornish, per the heavy associations of Dorne (and snakes) with scorpions:
&gt;… Joffrey received… a red gold brooch wrought in the shape of a scorpion from the Dornishman, Prince Oberyn (SOS San IV)

&gt;""Dorne is sand and scorpions, and bleak red mountains baking in the sun."" (DWD Dae VII)

&gt;[Dunk] would not leave his old friend to the **snakes and scorpions** and sand dogs [in Dorne]. (tSS)
***
&gt;…there was naught to be found [in Dorne] but snakes, scorpions, and sand. (TWOIAF)

Once we even ""see"" a stone snake next to a blatantly shoehorned scorpion reference (plus verbiage—""twisty alleys"" and colorful colors—reminiscent of Jon's picturesque winding climb)
&gt;Children wandered the twisty alleys and found old bronze coins and bits of purple glass and **stone flagons with handles carved like snakes.** One woman was stung by a red **scorpion**, but hers was the only death. (COK Dae I)

If there is thus a Dornish presence on Jon's trek in the person of Stonesnake, it makes sense that there's a Dornish presence near Brienne's walk. It's not Meribald. That would be too easy, just as it would be too easy if Stonesnake were Lewyn Martell, as some have argued. ASOIAF *rhymes*, it doesn't carbon-copy, and thus Brienne's journey yields up Elder Brother Lewyn (while pointing to Tyene the stork).

ASOIAF gradually opens up about its secrets, though. Thus in TWOW Arianne II, we read about *another* analogously colorful, tricksy journey, which for self-evident reasons (namely: it's Arianne *Martell's* POV!) is consistent with the idea that Brienne's path led to Lewyn Martell:
&gt;Dusk found them on the fringes of the rainwood, **a wet green world** where **brooks and rivers** ran through dark forests and **the ground was made of mud and rotting leaves**.  Huge **willows** grew along the watercourses, larger than any that Arianne had ever seen, their great trunks as gnarled and twisted as an old man’s face and festooned with beards of **silvery** moss. **Trees pressed close on every side, shutting out the sun**; hemlock and **red** cedars, **white** oaks, **soldier pines that stood as tall and straight as towers, colossal sentinels**, big-leaf maples, **red**woods, wormtrees, even here and there a wild weirwood. Underneath their tangled branches ferns and flowers grew in profusion; sword ferns, lady ferns, bellflowers and piper’s lace, evening stars and poison kisses, **liverwort,** lungwort, hornwort. Mushrooms sprouted down amongst the tree roots, and from their trunks as well, pale spotted hands that caught the rain. Other trees were furred with moss, **green or grey or red-tailed, and once a vivid purple.** Lichens covered every rock and stone. **Toadstools festered besides rotting logs.** The very air seemed **green.** …

&gt;**The going was much slower here than it had been in Dorne. Instead of proper roads, they rode down crookback slashes that snaked this way and that, through clefts in huge moss-covered rocks and down deep ravines choked with blackberry brambles. Sometimes the track petered out entirely, sinking into bogs or vanishing amongst the ferns, leaving Arianne and her companions to find their own way amongst the silent trees.** The rain still fell, soft and steady. The sound of moisture dripping off the leaves was all around them, and every mile or so the music of another little **waterfall** would call to them.

&gt;The wood was full of caves as well. That first night they took shelter in one of them, to get out of the wet. In Dorne they had often travelled after dark, when **the moonlight turned the blowing sands to silver**, but the rainwood was too full of **bogs, ravines, and sinkholes**, and **black as pitch** beneath the trees, where the moon was just a memory.

&gt;The cave proved much deeper than any of them had suspected. Beyond the stony mouth where her company had made their camp and hobbled their horses, a series of **twisty passageways led down and down, with black holes snaking off to either side. Further in, the walls opened up again**, and the searchers found themselves in a vast limestone cavern, larger than the great hall of a castle. **Their shouts disturbed a nest of bats, who flapped about them noisily**, but only distant echoes shouted back. A slow circuit of the hall revealed three further passages, **one so small that it would have required them to proceed on hands and knees.** …

&gt;The passageway Arianne had chosen for herself **turned steep and wet within a hundred feet. The footing grew uncertain. Once she slipped, and had to catch herself to keep from sliding.** More than once she considered turning back, but **she could see Ser Daemon’s torch ahead** and hear him calling for Elia, so she pressed on. …

&gt;The other searchers had found Elia, as she and Daemon learned after **they made their way back up the slippery slope** to the last hall. Their passageway led down to **a still black pool**, where they discovered the girl up to her waist in water, catching blind **white** fish with her bare hands, her torch burning **red** and smoky in the sand where she had planted it.

There's way too much interreferentiality here to discuss everything. If you go back and slowly re-read the Jon passage and the Brienne passage, the density of ""rhyming"" is stunning. 

- Again, we see a switchback trail ""that snaked this way and that"", specific hazards, a profusion of colors, lots of water (including a ""pool""), and the reflection of celestial light.

- ""Twisty passageways"" lead ""down and down"", as against Jon's ""twisting trails"" that ""snaked… upward, ever upward.""
- We see a passage that would require ""hands and knees"", as Jon's path required shuffling ""sideways like a crab"".
- The trees ""shutting out the sun"" recall ""hidden valleys that seldom saw the sun"" and the sun ""vanish[ing] behind jagged peaks"".
- The ""mud and rotting leaves"", ""fester[ing]"" toadstools and ""rotting logs"" call back to the muddy path of faith's ""brine and rot"".
- Arianne's ""bogs, ravines, and sinkholes"" in the ""black as pitch"" rainwood *and* her ""deep ravines choked with blackberry brambles"" sound like Jon's ""ravines so deep and black they seemed certain to end in some hell""
- The threat of ""sinking into bogs"" recalls Meribald warning Brienne that ""the wicked are swallowed by the quicksands"".

It's telling that it's in this loaded passage that's connected in so many ways to Brienne's path to Elder Brother's Quiet Isle that we find an already-analyzed reference to Lewyn being Elder Brother (i.e. the bits about ""soldier pines that stood as tall and straight as towers"", sentinels, and ""silent trees"").

It's also telling that we see ""blackberry brambles"", which evoke graves and hence the Quiet Isle with its graveyard, given that in *The Sworn Sword*, Ser Eustace's boys are buried ""down in the blackberries"":
&gt;""They died good deaths, fighting bravely for the king,"" Ser Eustace told Dunk, ""and **I brought them home and buried them among the blackberries."" His wife was buried there as well.**

Arianne's path ""peter[ing] out entirely"" and *""sinking into bogs or vanishing amongst the ferns""* rhymes perfectly with an *earlier* passage from Brienne's journey to Quiet Isle, in which Brienne's road was ""prone to *vanishing amongst the reeds and tidal pools""*. The surrounding prose overflows with motifs found in Arianne's and/or Jon's journeys:
&gt;The **steep hills, black bogs, and piney woods** of Crackclaw Point were nowhere to be found this side of Maidenpool. The lands they traveled through were low and **wet**, a wilderness of sandy dunes and salt marshes beneath a vast **blue-grey** vault of sky. Instead they struck off toward the northwest, following the shore of the Bay of Crabs on a crooked track so small that it did not appear on either of Ser Hyle's precious sheepskin maps. **The road was prone to vanishing amongst the reeds and tidal pools, only to appear again a mile farther on; without Meribald, Brienne knew, they surely would have lost their way.** The ground was often soft, so in places the septon would walk ahead, tapping with his quarterstaff to make certain of the footing. There were no trees for leagues around, just sea and sky and sand.

&gt;No land could have been more different from Tarth, with its **mountains and waterfalls, its high meadows and shadowed vales, yet this place had its own beauty**, Brienne thought. They crossed a dozen slow-flowing streams alive with frogs and crickets, **watched terns floating high above the bay,** heard the sandpipers calling from amongst the dunes. **Once a fox crossed their path, and set Meribald's dog to barking wildly.** (FFC B V)

Recall that Jon's climb similarly featured a soaring bird, a ""mountain meadow"" and ""hidden valleys that seldom saw the sun"". The fact that Brienne's high mountain meadows and ""shadowed vales"" are just memories only underscores that an intentional *textual* connection is being drawn: GRRM *contrived* to duplicate elements that he couldn't write as literally present in the Riverlands.

Meanwhile, Brienne's ""piney woods"" prefigure Arianne's symbolically-loaded pine trees, and her ""dozens of slow-flowing streams"" prefigure Arianne's ""brooks and rivers"". Brienne's fox setting Dog to barking recalls Arianne's party disturbing the bats, causing them to flap about ""noisily"". The line, *""Yet this place had its own beauty""* recalls this slice of Jon's journey:
&gt;Yet even so, Jon Snow was not sorry he had come. There were wonders here as well.

Clearly, then, Arianne Martell's journey rhymes with Brienne's—and with Jon's climb with the Dornishman Stonesnake as well. The kaleidoscoping motifs only strengthen my conviction that the Elder Brother of Quiet Isle is Arianne's great-uncle Lewyn Martell.

Throughout AFFC and ADWD, Cersie's chapters show us how genuinely bad she is at playing the game of thrones and shows us that her looks are starting to fade (the best example of this I can think of is how she blame's her handmaidens for shrinking her clothes when she is actually just getting fat from doing nothing but getting wine drunk 24/7 and her hair being cut off by the High Sparrow). Cersie makes a series of bad decisions as regent that could ultimately end in her downfall.

All of the choices made by the ""younger, and more beautiful"" Cersie will eventually catch up to and cause the downfall of the older and less beautiful Cersie that is around by the end of ADWD.

 I don't have a ton of evidence to back this up, but I thought it would fit well with the way that GRRM uses prophecy in his books and it made sense to me. What do you all think?",1,"(Spoilers Published) The Younger, more beautiful Queen",1113,54
0,1,0,21,19,"I've been away from the sub for a bit while I finished Fire &amp; Blood and sadly it took me a little longer than I thought since I was very busy with work these past couple weeks.

Anyways I wanted to post some of my thoughts/questions about Fire &amp; Blood that I jotted down while reading it. 

***

**Dragons**

1)**Sealord of Braavos has 3 Dragon eggs** - Probably the 3 eggs that Illyrio ends up giving to Dany

2)**Balerion's growth** - It says Balerion stops growing in 93 AC. Was this due to: 

a)old age (he dies within the year)

b)trip to Valyria or 

c)Dragonpit effect

***

**Errors/Mistakes**

1)**Age of Baelon/Alyssa** - I might have read this wrong, but doesn't TWOIAF make it seem like Alyssa is older, but in Fire &amp; Blood, Baelon is older (eta: u/cstapie brought to my attention the changes to all of Jahaerys I children)

2)**Sunfyre's torn wing** - It is mentioned that Sunfyre's left wing is torn, but the image on p. 453 clearly shows an injured right wing

***

**Questions**

1)**Alys Rivers** - What do you think happened to her and her child? As well as her ""dragon""?

2)**House Strong** - If they are extinguished, why would Qyburn use the name Strong for Frankengregor?

3)**Daemon Targaryen** - Do you think he survived the fall while Vhagar/Caraxes battled?

***

**Thoughts**

1)**Dance of the Dragons 2.0** - It is noted that when Tessarion/Seasmoke fought, it was a ""dance"" as they were both young/nimble/quick. As the Drogon/Rhaegal/Viserion are all extremely young, this seems likely how they will fight during the second dance as they won't be the size of Balerion (able to swallow a mammoth whole)

2)**Additional Sesame Street character** - We know have Kermit, Elmo, Grover and Oscar Tully

3)**Shakespear reference** - William Stakespear

4)**Targaryen sickness** - Daenerys Targaryen gets sick, which creeps out her parents (they recognize their mortality), but other Targaryen's die from the Great Spring Sickness. Just something I wanted to bring up and think about.

***

**The Sunset Sea Voyage**

1)**Lady Elissas Farman** possibly manages to reach Asshai via the west (Sunset Sea) as the Sea Snake sees what he believes to be the Sun Chaser on his voyage there

2)The islands, **Aegon/Visenya/Rhaenys** are now the farthest west anyone has been and lived to tell they tale. Also, the **sluggish grey lizards** ""as big as deer"" seem to be Komodo Dragon type reptiles? As a bite on the leg, turns it green and it had to be removed and Komodo Dragons are known to have toxic/poisonous (disputed) saliva.

3)We also get a **kraken** sighting as one seemingly (according to the sailors) takes down the Autumn Moon

4)Other species on Sothoryos in addition to the ones mentioned in TWIOAF including: **monkeys who walk like men** and **men who howl like monkeys** (possibly just Brindled Men).

5)Also a possible reference to Moby Dick,**white bull leviathan** that cracks the ship's hull

***

**Valyria**

It seems likely that Aerea Targaryen flew Balerion (he flew her) to Valyria based on Balerion's wounds/her injuries (which was on of the craziest parts of Fire &amp; Blood imo)

This made me think of two things:

1)**Euron**, if he has truly been to Valyria (Valyrian armor, etc.), than he must have made common cause with some ancient god, only went via a glass candle (Urrathon Night-walker) or have some other means of protection

2)**Sunfyre returns to Dragonstone** - When Sunfyre returns to Dragonstone after his injuries, the question is raised did he go there because of Aegon or because he was returning to his birthplace? It would make sense that he was returning to his birthplace if that is what Balerion did as well

***

**Dragons/Eggs after the Dance**

1)**Maelor's Egg** - The last I saw it mentioned, it was in the possession of the Hightower's

2)**Visery's Egg** - Aegon had it returned to Dragonstone, along with any others in the Red Keep (at least 7 more), meaning there are at least 8-9 eggs on Dragonstone and most likely much more

3)**Morning** - Rhaena took 3 eggs with her to the Vale (although it seems like it was mentioned that it was only 1 somewhere else?) and Morning hatched, which was the only dragon that is owned by a Targaryen after the Dance, and it seems she dies by 152 AC

4)**Silverwing** - Made his lair in the Red Lake

5)**Sheepstealer** - Vale w/Nettles

6)**The Cannibal** - Mysteriously vanishes after the War (although it should also be noted that most maester's do not think he lived on Dragonstone before the Targaryen's as it has been previously noted)

7)**Laena's hatchling** - stunted thing, killed by the Oakenfist after biting her

8)**Winterfell** - Although it says that Vermithor most likely didn't lay any eggs at Winterfell, Fire &amp; Blood doubles down about Septon's Barth's (who is always right) claim that dragons are intersex

**Welcome to my *Secret History of House Martell* series: a wholesale revision and expansion of my nutty ideas regarding all things Nymeros-Martell.**

In the first ""chapter"" of the series, I'll argue for the following propositions (which I acknowledge will at first blush strike many folks as outlandish, clearly absurd, batshit crazy, and/or surely devoid of any textual support):

- Quiet Isle's Elder Brother is now in the Vale in the guise of Ser Morgarth the Merry, a hedge knight hired by (an unwitting) Littlefinger. He is likely seeking Sansa Stark in concert with ""Ser Shadrich"" and ""Ser Byron the Beautiful"" (who are also not what they seem, although that will not be argued here).

- The man known as both Elder Brother and Ser Morgarth is in fact Prince Lewyn Martell of Dorne, who is ""dead"" in the same sense Sandor Clegane is ""dead"".
- Elder Brother/Ser Morgarth the Merry/Prince Lewyn Martell has an older brother: Archmaester Marywn ""The Mage"". They are both the younger brothers of the nameless former ruling Princess of Dorne, who birthed Doran, Elia, and Oberyn. Marwyn is thus the great-uncle of Sarella Sand AKA Alleras the Sphinx.
- Obara Sand is almost certainly not Oberyn's daughter but Marwyn's.
- Oberyn's daughter Tyene Sand is already in King's Landing in the guise of the pock-marked, storky novice appearing in ADWD's Epilogue.

These hypotheses and the evidence for them are highly interdependent, so it might not be until I'm talking about Marwyn being Obara's daddy or about Tyene-the-stork-novice that the evidence coalesces and dovetails such that the earlier hypotheses start to feel grounded.

##The Oberyn/Salty Dornish Obfuscation
The arguments I'll be making will be easier to swallow if you provisionally grant *as a possibility* a couple additional, interrelated hypotheses:

- First, Oberyn Martell and his daughters (save for Obara, who I'll argue isn't his daughter) are in several important ways *not physically typical Martells*, notwithstanding the fact that Oberyn possesses traits that *are* typical of the ""lithe and dark"" salty Dornishmen in general. (SOS Ty V)

- Second, members of House Martell aren't always obviously ""salty Dornish"" in appearance. Specifically, they are sometimes physically large and not dramatically ""swarthy"".

It's my belief that Oberyn's physically-attractive, graceful, tall, long-legged, slender-handed, smooth-skinned, sharp-nosed, big-and-wet-and-dark-eyed physicality and the similar looks of his known daughters (minus Obara, who isn't his) are largely related to his paternity and are not indicative of what Martells—including the men of his Martell mother's generation—look like. (I'll talk about Oberyn's paternity in the next chapter of my Secret History of House Martell.)

I submit that Oberyn's early introduction is a masterstroke of obfuscation: after coming to identify him as the face of House Martell, how many readers would even *consider* that ugly, thickly-built, ham-handed, heavy-jawed, big-and-square headed, hirsute men like Elder Brother, Ser Morgarth and Marwyn the Mage might be his Martell uncles?

We're misled not just by Oberyn being the first and only Martell we meet until AFFC, but also by what we're told at that time about the Dornish in general. We meet Oberyn when the Dornish come to King's Landing. As they arrive, Tyrion tells us the ""stony Dornishmen"" of the mountains are the ""biggest"" Dornishmen, ""sons of the Andals and the First Men"", whereas the ""salty Dornishmen""—who ""lived along the coast"" (where the Martells live!) and who are ""lithe and dark"" (like Oberyn!)—have ""the most Rhoynish blood"". (SOS Ty V)

It's thus seems merely logical that the Rhoynish-blooded salty Dornishmen are the smallest Dornishmen, and that they're the reason people believe the Dornishmen *in general* are small:
&gt;""The Dornish paint their silks, I've heard, but **you look too big to be a Dornishman.**"" (tSS)
***
&gt;She had always heard that **Dornishmen were small and swarthy**, with black hair and small black eyes… (SOS A VIII)

Given that (a) Oberyn's house descends from Nymeria, Queen of the Rhoynar, (b) Tyrion dubs Oberyn a ""salty Dornishmen for certain"", (c) Oberyn's face is ""saturnine"" (which [can mean ""swarthy""](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/language-blog/bal-in-a-word-saturnine-20171120-story.html)), (d) Oberyn has the ""black hair and… black eyes"" Arya has heard ""small and swarthy"" Dornishmen have (although his eyes are actually quite large), and (e) Oberyn is at least ""slender"", if not small per se, we're clearly being tempted to conclude that the Nymeros-Martells—who after all *proclaim* their Rhoynish blood in their names—are in general paradigmatic salty Dornishmen: small (or at least lithe) and swarthy.

Notice, though, that Tyrion isn't speaking from personal observation. He's citing a book written 140 years ago by a boy-king who died at age 18—a book that's demonstrably wrong about both Dornish culture—
&gt; Low of roof and wide abeam, the poleboats had hardly any draft to speak of; **the Young Dragon had disparaged them as ""hovels built on rafts,"" but that was hardly fair. All but the poorest orphan boats were wonderfully carved and painted.** (FFC tQM)

—and its titular topic, *The Conquest of Dorne*:
&gt;[Jon:] ""When the Young Dragon conquered Dorne, he used a goat track to bypass the Dornish watchtowers on the Boneway.""

&gt;""I know that tale as well, but **Daeron made too much of it in that vainglorious book of his. Ships won that war, not goat tracks**. Oakenfist broke the Planky Town and swept halfway up the Greenblood whilst the main Dornish strength was engaged in the Prince's Pass."" (DWD J IV)

This raises the possibility that the clear-cut Dornish phenotypes Tyrion posits may not be so clear-cut after all. Real world experience with colonial conquest (e.g. Spain's casta system) and race is instructive here: The ""knowledge"" that a person ""is"" this or that ""race"" causes people to *see* them as such; ignorance of what one is *supposed* to be seeing can blur the lines considerably, as can the context in which someone appears.

Still, surely there's *some* truth to Tyrion's claim that the stony Dornish ""sons of the Andals and the First Men"" are the ""biggest"", right? After all, the fact that ""the Big Man"" Archibald Yronwood hails from a stony Dornish house conveniently backs him up! True. *However.*

##The Martells Are Not Average Salty Dornishmen
While it may very well be the case that the heavily Rhoynish salty Dornishmen *in general* are ""small and swarthy"" and ""lithe and dark"", I believe that the Martells themselves are often anything but small or lithe. Yes, the house was co-founded by Nymeria of the Rhoynar, and yes, an abundance of Rhoynish blood may mean the average, lowborn salty Dornishman is smaller and lither than the average sandy or stony Dornishmen. But House Nymeros-Martell was *also* founded by Mors Martell, who descended from an Andal adventurer who defeated and surely intermarried with the First Men living in the area. While most of the Rhoynish immigrants and their descendants who identified as Rhoynish surely stayed in the area and for centuries married other similar people living in the vicinity, *thereby producing the ""known"" salty Dornish phenotype,* it was surely regularly incumbent on the genetically half-Andal Martells to seek peace-making marriages of alliance with far-flung Dornish houses which did *not* have as much Rhoynish blood.

After all, Nymeria herself took an Uller/Andal second husband and a Dayne/first man third husband. Moreover, given centuries of antipathy between the stony House Yronwood and the originally salty Nymeros-Martells—
&gt;Before Nymeria came, the Kings of Yronwood were the most powerful house in all of Dorne—far greater than the Martells of the time. They ruled half of Dorne—a fact that, to this day, the Yronwoods let no one forget. **In the centuries after House Martell rose to the rule of Dorne, the Yronwoods have been the house likeliest to rebel, and have done so several times.** (TWOIAF)

—it's overwhelmingly likely the ruling Princes and Princesses of Sunspear have over the years regularly taken Yronwood consorts in an effort to quell the bad blood between their houses, much as the Blackwoods and Brackens have intermarried countless times over the millennia:
&gt;""We've had a hundred peaces with the Brackens, many sealed with marriages. There's Blackwood blood in every Bracken, and Bracken blood in every Blackwood."" (DWD Jai I)

Thus it's likely that the often-large Yronwoods have Martell blood in them, and that the Martells are often somewhat less obviously Rhoynish in appearance than most assume, as hinted at by Quentyn (and thus perhaps Doran, whom Quentyn ""looks like""/""looks too much like""), who isn't lithe like a salty Dornishman at all, but instead *""short-legged and stocky, thickly built*"". (FFC PitT; DWD MM)

##Mariah Martell's Sons
The *real* clue, though, the thing that tells us that Quentyn is not some aberration and that the Martells of recent generations have not all been lithe and slender like Oberyn and/or ""small and swarthy"" like a stereotypical salty Dornishmen, is the powerful, imposing appearances of Baelor Breakspear and Maekar Targaryen, who were *maternal Martells*: the sons of *Mariah Martell* and Daeron II. Given that Daeron was notably ""small of frame""—
&gt;[Daeron] was small of frame, with thin arms, round shoulders, and a scholarly disposition… (TWOIAF)

—it's likely that Mariah's Martell blood played a big role in producing the ""tall tall"" (even to Dunk!), puissant Baelor *""Breakspear""* and the much shorter but ""powerful"" Maekar, who was ""stocky"" and ""thickly built"", *verbatim like Quentyn*. (tHK) Not least because Baelor was Known as ""more Martell than Targaryen"":
&gt;Yet too many men looked upon Baelor's dark hair and eyes and muttered that **he was more Martell than Targaryen.** (TWOIAF)

Note that no one ""muttered"" that Mariah's other two, very different sons—the ""bookish"", ""spindly and stooped"" Aerys I and the ""meek and sickly"" Rhaegel—took after her, which again suggests that Baelor and Maekar's imposing appearances had much to do with their mother's Martell blood. (SSM 11.1.2005; tHK)

So who was Mariah Martell, who birthed the great warriors Baelor Breakspear and Maekar I? None other than the sister of Dorne's ruling Prince Maron Martell, from whose marriage to the diminutive Daeron II's sister Daenerys *all present day Martells descend.*

Maron and Daenerys were married c. 187. Doran was born c. 247/248, so he is surely either their great or great-great-grandson, making Doran's uncle Prince Lewyn (and any brother Lewyn may have) their grandson(s) or great-grandson(s). Given that Baelor and Maekar were anything but ""small"" and ""lithe"", might not their *double* first cousins, once or twice removed be big, strong, powerful men as well?

I'll have lots more to say about Baelor and Maekar as we proceed. Here I just wanted to establish *prima facie* reason to consider that it might not only be Dornishmen carrying the names of stony houses who belie the stereotype of the small Dornishman, but sometimes also the princes of House Martell itself. As we're about to see, this is exemplified by both Lewyn Martell, AKA Elder Brother of Quiet Isle AKA Ser Morgarth the Merry, and his brother Archmaester Marwyn ""the Mastiff"" Martell.

With that, let's jump into a comparative analysis of the descriptions of Elder Brother, Ser Morgarth, Marwyn, the known Martells—especially Quentyn and Doran—and the maternal Martell ""Targaryens"" of *The Hedge Knight*, Baelor Breakspear and Maekar. 

##""Elder Brother""
Let's begin with the descriptions of Elder Brother and Ser Morgarth the Merry, whom I believe are one and the same. Here's Elder Brother:
&gt;He could **hardly be called elder**, for a start; whereas the brothers weeding in the garden had had the stooped shoulders and bent backs of old men, **he stood straight and tall**, and moved with the vigor of a man in the prime of his years. Nor did he have the gentle, kindly face she expected of a healer. **His head was large and square, his eyes shrewd, his nose veined and red.** Though he wore a tonsure, his **scalp was as stubbly as his heavy jaw**.

&gt;He looks more like **a man made to break bones than to heal them**, thought the Maid of Tarth…
***
&gt;[Brienne tells the Elder Brother:] ""You look more like **a knight** than you do a holy man."" It was **written in his chest and shoulders**, and across that **thick square jaw.** (FFC B VI)

One more key datum is squirreled away amid dialog: He has ""big hands"".
&gt;[The Elder Brother] leaned forward, his **big hands** on his knees.

##""Ser Morgarth""
Compare that description with what we see of Ser Morgarth, who first appears in the Vale ten chapters after Brienne leaves Elder Brother, which comports with the idea that in the wake of Brienne's visit, Elder Brother leaves Quiet Isle and, in the guise of Morgarth, travels to the Vale with Ser Shadrich (Howland Reed) to hunt down Sansa Stark.

Morgarth is…
&gt;a **burly** fellow with a **thick salt-and-pepper beard, a red nose bulbous with broken veins, and gnarled hands as large as hams.** (FFC Al II)

Let's line things up:

- Ser Morgarth is ""burly"". Elder Brother looks like a bone-breaker and a knight, especially in *""his chest and shoulders""*. Per ASOIAF, being ""burly"" like Morgarth entails both a big chest—
    &gt;he was **bigger across the chest, burlier…** (DWD tW)

    —and big shoulders—
    &gt;Mormont was big and **burly, …thick of shoulder.** (SOS Dae I)
    ***
     &gt;**Burly and broad-shouldered**, forty if he was a day… (DWD Ty VI)

    —*exactly like Elder Brother.*

- Ser Morgarth has a ""red nose bulbous with broken veins""; Elder Brother has a ""nose veined and red"".
- Ser Morgarth has ""gnarled hands as large as hams""; Elder Brother has ""big hands"".
- Ser Morgarth has a ""thick"" beard; Elder Brother has a ""thick"" jaw and dense stubble ripe for thick beard growth.
- Ser Morgarth's ""salt-and-pepper beard"" indicates black hair going grey, which marries well with Elder Brother having seen ""four-and-forty name days"". (FFC B VI) (Might ""salt-and-pepper"" nod to him being, in truth, a *""salty""* Dornishman—said Dornish being famed for their ""fiery Dornish *peppers*""? [SOS Ty X])

##The Merry
Ser Morgarth is called Morgarth *the Merry*. The epithet ""Merry"" hints at his other two identities in a few ways. First, Marillion tells Sansa, ""Mead only makes me *merry*"", whereas Elder Brother's Quiet Isle's mead is ""far famed"" and ""excellent"". (SOS San VI; FFC B VI)

Second, consider what Petyr says about Randa Royce:
&gt;""She likes to play the **merry** fool, but **underneath she's shrewder** than her father.""

We read this as the all-knowing Littlefinger seeing through Randa's affectation, but won't his smugness prove ironic when it's revealed that ""underneath"" Ser Morgarth the *Merry*, who Littlefinger believes to be a mere hedge knight, is the ""shrewd"" eyed Elder Brother, AKA Prince Lewyn Martell (who has a minor bone to pick with Littlefinger's man Lyn Corbray).

Speaking of Lewyn becoming the holy Elder Brother, who is now Ser Morgarth ""the Merry"", this passage about people pretending to be priests jumps off the page as metatext:
&gt;***Merry* always claimed the mummers made much better priests than priests**, especially Myrmello. (FFC CotC)

Finally, this passage—
&gt;And ""Merry"" was what she was to call boisterous plump Meredyth Crane, but most definitely not Lady Merryweather, a sultry black-eyed Myrish beauty. (SOS San I)

—is suspiciously awkward. Why does GRRM highlight the fact that Taena Merryweather's name contains the word ""Merry""? Perhaps because ""Morgarth the Merry"" is Lewyn Martell and (as I'll argue in a future chapter of this Secret History) Taena is his nephew Oberyn's bastard daughter and one of Doran's ""friends at court"".

##""Burly Fellows"" Of the Kingsguard and Elder Brother Lewyn: Silent, Straight and Tall as a Tower
Let's fold in some wordplay hinting that Elder Brother, Morgarth and Lewyn are all the same dude. We just saw that Sansa thinks of Ser Morgarth as *""a burly fellow""*. Curiously, the *only* other time Sansa uses the term ""fellow"" refers to the Kingsguard—
&gt;Ser Mandon Moore went to take his place under the throne beside two of his **fellows of the Kingsguard.** (GOT S V)

—while the very passage which confirms that being ""burly"" like Morgarth means having a big chest like Elder Brother associates ""burly"" with (a) the Kingsguard and (b) House Martell, since it's de facto Martell Areo Hotah who says that Ser Balon Swann is…
&gt;…bigger across the chest [than fellow Kingsguard Arys Oakheart], burlier, his arms thick with muscle. (DWD tW)

Hotah's very next words are about Ser Balon's ""snowy cloak"", which recalls an image of ""soldier pines and sentinels"" cloaked in white *by snow*:
&gt;Snowflakes drifted down soundlessly **to *cloak* the soldier pines and sentinels in white.** (DWD B III)

Kingsguards are both sentinels and soldiers, of course, so the symbolism is obvious. And what does *Arianne Martell* say such about ""soldier pines""? That they…
&gt;…**stood as tall and straight as a tower**… (WOW Ar II)

…a phrase which just so happens to perfectly combine Prince Lewyn being *""tall as a tower""* with the fact that Elder Brother *""stood straight and tall""* while also referring to ""soldiers"", which both men were. (tSK) Moments later, Arianne references ""silent trees"", which is consistent with the idea that this verbiage is hinting that Elder Brother of Quiet Isle, whose brothers take ""a vow of silence"", is Lewyn Martell of the Kingsguard. (FFC B VI)

It also so happens that the only other person in ASOIAF who is described verbatim as ""straight and tall"" like Elder Brother is, *like Lewyn Martell,* a prince: the Tattered Prince, who is, like Elder Brother, curiously nameless.

##Prince Lewyn Martell of Dorne: A Good Man. A Valiant Prince.
We aren't told much about Prince Lewyn. Jaime groups him with Sers Whent and Darry, *""good men every one.""* (SOS Jai VIII) Selmy thinks:
&gt;""Prince Lewyn was **as valiant a brother-in-arms as any man could wish for**."" (DWD Dan VIII)

Might not a good and valiant ""brother-in-arms"" like Prince Lewyn help Howland Reed (""Ser Shadrich"") extricate Sansa Stark from the aegis of a seeming shitbag like Littlefinger? Certainly.

Another word for ""valiant"" is ""gallant"". (https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/gallant; https://www.thefreedictionary.com/gallant) Thus when Meribald likens a holy man to a gallant prince while en route to Elder Brother's Quiet Isle—
&gt;""I was young and full of sap, and the girls… **a septon can seem as gallant as a prince** if he is the only man you know who has ever been more than a mile from your village."" (FFC B V)

—I read it as hinting that Elder Brother was once the ""valiant"" Prince Lewyn. Likewise, when Sansa calls ""Ser Morgarth"" and his two companions ""gallant""—
&gt;Alayne laughed. ""Are you louts?"" she said, teasing. ""Why, I took the three of you for **gallant** knights."" (FFC Ala II)

—it's foreshadowing that the ""gallant"" Morgarth is ""also"" the ""valiant"" Prince Lewyn.

Notice that it's a guy named ""Meribald"" (Merry-bald) who compares holy men to gallant princes like Lewyn, and I'm arguing that the tonsured (i.e pointedly *bald*) Elder Brother becomes the explicitly ""gallant"", no-longer-bald ""Ser Morgarth the *Merry*"".

##Lewyn the Tickler
Arianne says Lewyn…
&gt;""…used to tickle me until I could not breathe for laughing."" (FFC tSK)

Sounds like a ""merry"" fellow, no?

##Knightly Shoulders, Hidden Martells and the Kingsguard
Elder Brother admits to having been a knight, and we're told it is ""written in his chest and shoulders"". That verbiage is curiously reminiscent of Pate's description of Mollander when Mollander is throwing an apple for Alleras, who is, like Elder Brother, a disguised Martell (Sarella Sand):
&gt;""The apple,"" **Alleras** said. ""Unless you mean to eat it.""

&gt;""Here."" Dragging his clubfoot, Mollander took a short hop, whirled, and whipped the apple sidearm into the mists that hung above the Honeywine. If not for his foot, **he would have been a knight like his father. He had the strength for it in those thick arms and broad shoulders.** (FFC Pro)

More than that, [I have argued that Mollander is in fact the son of Ser Dontos Hollard](https://asongoficeandtootles.wordpress.com/2016/09/14/the-affc-prologue-does-ser-dontos-have-a-posse/). The Hollards were famously allies to and intermarried with the Darklyns since the Age of Heroes. And what are the Darklyns known for?
&gt;[The swords] stood for the seven sons of Darklyn who had worn the white cloaks of the Kingsguard. No other house in all the realm could claim as many. (FFC B II)

Being Kingsguards, like Prince Lewyn.

##Youthful Vigor and Gout
There's a nifty irony to Elder Brother ""mov[ing] with the *vigor* of a man in the prime of his years"" if he is indeed Lewyn, the younger uncle of Doran, who is by contrast aged beyond his years by gout and aching joints —
&gt;Though he was but two-and-fifty, Doran Martell seemed much older. (FFC CotG)

—*especially* considering that the canon contains an explicit juxtaposition of Elder Brother-ish ""young man's vigor"" against gouty, aching joints like Doran's:
&gt;**He no longer had a young man’s *vigor* and was afflicted by *gout, aching joints*,** back pain, and a tightness in the chest… (tRP)

##Brown-And-Dun
The Martells' seat of power so happens to be described using the exact same color scheme—
&gt;Sunspear was built from mud and straw, and **colored brown and dun**. (AFFC The Captain of the Guards)

—as the *""brown-and-dun robes""* worn by the holy brothers of Quiet Isle. (FFC B VI)

##A Harpist. Arthur Dayne and ""Elder Brother""
During the meal Brienne eats on Quiet Isle, a holy brother plays the high harp until he is excused by Elder Brother. I suspect this is a wink at Elder Brother Lewyn's close relationship with Rhaegar—
&gt;The Dornishmen who had come to court with the Princess Elia were in [Rhaegar's] confidence as well, **particularly Prince Lewyn Martell**… (TWOIAF) 

—whose prowess with the high harp is first noted by Barristan Selmy, Lewyn's Kingsguard brother. (SOS Dae IV) I suspect it's no accident that the holy harpist *""filling the hall with soft sweet sounds""* recalls a singer who *""fill[ed] the hall with the sweet music of the high harp""* while singing *""of Nymeria's ten thousand ships""*, i.e. of the founder of Lewyn's House Nymeros-Martell. (FFC B VI; COK S VI)

Lewyn was also ""brother"" to Arthur Dayne. Was GRRM winking at Lewyn's whereabouts when he contrived to have Edric Dayne speak of Arthur's ""elder brother""?
&gt;""My father was Ser Arthur's **elder brother**."" (SOS Ar VIII)

##Quick To Anger, Slow To Forgive
Doran says:
&gt;""We Dornish are a hot-blooded people, **quick to anger and slow to forgive.**"" (FFC tSK)

Elder Brother says his previous life was one of  ""fighting"" and ""blood"", which is consistent with him being an easily angered Dornishman. We also see Elder Brother being ""slow to forgive"", when he tells Meribald:
&gt;""…no doubt Ser Quincy will ask you for forgiveness. I am glad that you are here to give it. I could not."" (FFC B VI)

Who else are ""quick to anger""? Targaryens:
&gt;Aegon II was two-and-twenty, **quick to anger and slow to forgive.** (P&amp;Q)
***
&gt;It is said that he and his wife quarreled before the voyage, for **Lady Baela was of the blood of the dragon and quick to anger…** (F&amp;B 702)

So? So, Lewyn ""Martell"" is just as Targaryen as the ""Targaryens"" of his generation, being a descendant of Maron Martell's marriage to Daenerys Targaryen, just as the ""Targaryens"" were descendants of Maron's sister Mariahs's marriage to Daenerys's brother Daeron II.

##Do Not Disturb the Martells
Elder Brother's concern that Quiet Isle not be ""disturb[ed]""—
&gt;""The Elder Brother will know more. He keeps the worst of the tidings from outside to himself, **so as not to disturb the tranquility of the septry**."" (ibid)

—calls back to Lewyn's nephew Doran's foregrounded interest in the same in AFFC CotG:
&gt;""The prince does not wish to be disturbed.""
***
&gt;""And you say, he does not wish to be disturbed!""

&gt;""He does not wish to be disturbed,"" Areo Hotah said again.
***
&gt;""The prince… is never to be disturbed when he is watching the children at their play.""

##A Young Great-Uncle
Some will argue that Lewyn cannot be the 44-year-old Elder Brother, given that he is 52-year-old Doran's uncle and Quentyn's great-uncle, but ASOIAF goes out of its way to demonstrate that uncles can be younger than their nephews. (DWD Dae VIII) Most famously, Dany was born about 25 years after Rhaegar, and—if you believe she is Rhaegar's sister—was younger than her niece Rhaenys and nephew Aegon.

Better still, GRRM gives us a tidy parallel to Doran and Lewyn in the Waynwoods. Lady Anya Waynwood's *grandson* Ser Roland Waynwood is about 25—
&gt;Ser Roland was the oldest of the three, though no more than five-and-twenty. (WOW Ala I)

—whereas Roland's *uncle* and Anya's youngest *son*, Ser Wallace Waynwood, is just knighted, probably 16-18:
&gt;""The Waynwood wheel has a broken spoke, and we have my nuncle here."" Ser Roland gave Wallace a whap behind the ear. ""Squires should be quiet when knights are speaking.""

&gt;Ser Wallace reddened. ""I am no more a s-squire, my lady. My n-nephew knows full well that I was k-k-kni-k-k-kni—"" (ibid)

Roland is about 8 years older than his uncle Wallace—just as Doran is about 8 years older than *his* uncle Elder Brother—because Anya birthed Roland's father Morton *at least* 20 years before she had Wallace. A similar situation would entirely explain Doran being 8 years Lewyn's senior. (Indeed, a similar situation, albeit less extreme, occurred when the Martells and Targaryens intermarried: Daeron II's half-Martell son Baelor was two years older than his own aunt, Daeron's sister, the original Daenerys.)

Alternately, if Doran's mother's *father* (rather than Doran's mother's mother) ruled Dorne before Doran's mother, Lewyn's mother could have simply been a second younger wife taken after Doran's grandmother died. Here, consider the Freys: Ryman Frey is at least 43 years older than one of his aunts.

Notice that Lewyn being 44 c. AFFC means he was about 23 when he ""had come to court with Princess Elia"", who betrothed and married Rhaegar in 279. 23 is a normal, unremarkable age at which to join the Kingsguard: the same age at which Criston Cole and Barristan Selmy joined. (TWOIAF; tRP; DWD tQG) Conventional scenarios which assume Lewyn would be very old today have a very hard time explaining how he either (a) joined the Kingsguard at an advanced age without comment or (b) can be said to ""come to court"" with Elia despite already being in the Kingsguard.

##Shrewd Eyes
Elder Brother has ""shrewd"" eyes, which are very rare in ASOIAF: there are only five other people with shrewd eyes in the canon. The only eyes that are *repeatedly* ""shrewd"" aren't human—they're raven. Every time a raven's eyes are called ""shrewd"", they're also called ""black""—
&gt;Mormont's raven watched with **shrewd black eyes**… (DWD J I)
***
&gt;…the Old Bear's raven peered down at him with **shrewd black eyes.** (DWD J III)
***
&gt;…the third raven looked at him with **shrewd black eyes**… (DWD B III)

—which oddly happens only after we meet the ""shrewd-eyed"" Elder Brother.

This conflation of shrewd eyes with black eyes is consistent with the shrewd-eyed Elder Brother being Lewyn Martell. Lewyn's niece Elia Martell had ""black eyes."" (FFC C V) Tyrion notes that Oberyn's eyes are ""black and shiny as pools of coal oil"". (SOS Ty V) Arianne's eyes are ""bold and black as sin"". (FFC tSK)

Given the association of ""shrewd"" eyes with ravens, it's interesting that raven eyes are twice called ""small black eyes""—
&gt;The ravens could speak it, though. **Their small black eyes were full of secrets**… (DWD B)
***
&gt;Ravens were walking on the rafters overhead, peering down with **small black eyes** and quorking at him. (tSS)

—which matches verbatim both what Arya tells us about Dornishmen—
&gt;She had always heard that Dornishmen were small and swarthy, with black hair and **small black eyes**. (SOS A VIII)

—and what Arys Oakheart reports about the Dornish *of Sunspear:*
&gt;He could feel eyes upon him everywhere he went, **small black Dornish eyes** regarding him with thinly veiled hostility. (FFC tSK)

One of the five other shrewd-eyed characters in the canon, Uthor Underleaf of *The Sworn Sword* (whose role as a ""signpost"" linking secret and known Martells I'll discuss in detail later) has ""*small* and shrewd"" eyes, bridging the gap between the ""small"" eyes of Sunspear and the ""shrewd-eyed"" Elder Brother. Another, Tycho Nestoris, has ""shrewd *dark* eyes"". Again, this may hint that Elder Brother's shrewd eyes are dark 'n' Dornish. (DWD tS)

To be clear: Elder Brother may not have small and/or black eyes. But calling Elder Brother's eyes ""shrewd"" while repeatedly associating ""shrewd"" eyes with black and small eyes subtly associates him with the Dornish and the Martells.

One of the other three characters with ""shrewd"" eyes is Qhorin Halfhand. (COK J VII) I've long argued (and will detail extensively in a future post) that Qhorin is in fact the ""dead"" Gerold Hightower, who was Lewyn's Lord Commander in Rhaegar's Kingsguard. While Qhorin being Gerold is an argument beyond the scope of this writing, there's wonderful symmetry if two ""dead"" Kingsguards both have ""shrewd"" eyes.

Finally and best of all, we see Maekar Targaryen give Dunk ""a shrewd look"" in *The Hedge Knight.* Again, Maekar was the son of *Mariah Martell* and Daeron Targaryen, who were respectively sister to Maron Martell and brother to Daenerys Targaryen, who together *begat modern day House Martell.* I'll discuss Maekar the maternal Martell more later, but I suspect the rhyme is there to hint at the blood ties between him and his cousin Elder Brother.

##Marwyn Martell vs. Elder Brother Lewyn
Speaking of blood ties, nearly everything we're told about Archmaester Marwyn is consistent with the idea that the text is encoding him as Elder Brother's/Ser Morgarth's/Lewyn Martell's brother, Doran's (and even Oberyn's) uncle, and Quentyn's and Arianne's great-uncle.

Just as ""Elder Brother was not what Brienne had expected"", neither is Marwyn what Sam expected:
&gt;Marwyn wore a chain of many metals around his **bull's neck**. Save for that, he **looked more like a dockside thug than a maester. His head was too big for his body**, and the way it thrust forward from his shoulders, together with that **slab of jaw**, made him look **as if he were about to tear off someone's head.** Though **short and squat**, he was **heavy in the chest and shoulders,** with a **round, rock-hard ale belly** straining at the laces of the leather jerkin he wore in place of robes. **Bristly white hair sprouted** from his ears and nostrils. His **brow beetled, his nose had been broken more than once**, and **sourleaf** had stained his teeth a mottled red. He had **the biggest hands that Sam had ever seen**. (FFC S V)

In both *form* and substance, this description of Marwyn ""rhymes"" with the description of Elder Brother, just as we might expect if they are brothers, with both men defying the images their titles conjure:

- Elder Brother ""could hardly be called elder,"" but ""moved with the vigor of a man in the prime of his years. Nor did he have the gentle, kindly face she expected of a healer."" Marwyn ""*looked more like a* dockside thug than a maester"", let alone most readers' idea of a ""mage"".

- Elder Brother ""*looks more like a* man made to break bones than to heal them"". Marwyn similarly ""look[s] as if he were about to tear off someone's head"".

- Brienne tells Elder Brother, ""You *look more like a* knight than you do a holy man"". Pate thinks, ""Marwyn *looked more a* mastiff than a maester."" (FFC Pro)

##Marwyn the Mastiff
Marwyn is called ""mastiff"" again:
&gt;Leo yawned. ""The sea is wet, the sun is warm, and the menagerie hates **the mastiff**."" (FFC Pro)

If Marwyn looks like a mastiff, he surely has a square head:
&gt;Mastiffs possess characteristics unique to the breed, especially the head with a broad, deep muzzle with flews hanging over the bottom lip, **giving the head a square appearance.** (Mastiff Club of America website)
***
&gt;*General Appearance*

&gt;**Head, in general outline, giving a square appearance** when viewed from any point. (The Old English Mastiff Club website)

This marries perfectly with Marwyn being the older brother of Elder Brother, whose head is ""large and *square*"".

AFFC confirms that GRRM is aware of the square-mastiff association:
&gt;…with a **square jutting chin** that his close-cropped yellow beard did little to conceal, **[Kevan] reminded her of some old mastiff**… (FFC C II)

##The Mastiff-Dragon Cypher
Marwyn's mastiff-like appearance recalls this description of the skulls of the last Targaryen dragons—
&gt;The most recent were also the smallest; a matched pair **no bigger than mastiff's skulls, and oddly misshapen**, all that remained of the last two hatchlings born on Dragonstone. (GOT Ty II)

—which is consistent with my hypothesis that ASOIAF is encoding the similarly misshapen (""His head was too big for his body"") Marwyn as a Martell prince of Dorne who is two generations closer to the original Daenerys Targaryen than is Quentyn, who reminds us:
&gt;""I am a prince of Dorne, and the blood of dragons is in my veins."" (DWD tSS)

Curiously, two of the only analogues in the canon to the phrase ""oddly misshapen"" (which memorably describes the Marwyn-the-mastiff-eque dragon skulls) just *happen* to crop up vis-a-vis (a) *Elder Brother's* strange furniture (about which I'll have more to say later)—
&gt;All were made from driftwood, **oddly shaped** pieces cunningly joined together… (FFC B VI)

—and (b) the wine-stain birthmark of Bloodraven, a Targaryen bastard and hence, like the Martells, a kind of quasi-dragon:
&gt;Across his cheek and chin spread a **wine-stain** birthmark that was supposed to resemble a red raven, though Dunk only saw an **odd-shaped** blotch of discolored skin. (tMK)

Notice that Bloodraven's ""odd-shaped"" birthmark being a ""wine-stain"" closes the referential loop, recalling both Marwyn's drug-stained teeth—
&gt;sourleaf had stained his teeth a mottled red. (FFC S V)

—and Elder Brother's *""life writ in red, in blood and wine""*. (FFC B VI)

##Marwyn vs. Elder Brother/Morgarth, Round 2

Meanwhile, further similarities between Elder Brother/Morgarth and Marwyn abound.

- Elder Brother Lewyn has a ""heavy jaw"" and a ""thick square jaw"". Marwyn has a ""slab of jaw"".

- Elder Brother's head is ""large"". Marwyn's head is ""too big for his body"".

- Elder Brother looks like a knight ""in his chest and shoulders"". As Morgarth, he's ""burly"", which ASOIAF associates with a big chest and big shoulders. And Marwyn? He's ""heavy in the chest and shoulders"".

- Elder Brother's ""big hands"" are ""gnarled hands as large as hams"" when he's Morgarth. Marwyn has ""the biggest hands that Sam had ever seen"" (which, by the way, remind us of ""the biggest feet that Brienne had ever seen"", which belong to Meribald, *the guy who introduces us to Elder Brother*).

- More subtly/textually, Elder Brother's bulbous, veiny red nose is that of an admitted ""drunk"". As Morgarth his nose has *""broken""* veins. Marwyn's nose is ""*broken* more than once"", his sourleaf habit stains his teeth red and connotes an addictive personality, and his belly is called an ""*ale* belly"".

- Both men are hirsute: Elder Brother is ""stubbly"". That stubble grows into Morgarth's ""*thick* salt-and-pepper beard"". Marwyn has ""bristly white hair sprout[ing] from his ears and nostrils"" and ""his brow beetled."" Given that Sam finds it notable that Marwyn's ear and nostril hair is white (like salt), might his beetling eyebrows and the hair on his head be dark (like pepper)?

- When telling his life story, which I see as a riff on the Faceless Men's ""lying game"", Elder Brother Lewyn talks about ""fighting"" and living a life ""writ in red, in blood"". Marwyn's nose ""had been broken more than once"" as if by fighting, and he is rumored to have ""killed a man with his fists"", which sounds pretty bloody.

##Marwyn's Nose and Baelor Breakspear
I've mentioned that Marwyn's ""nose had been broken more than once"" a couple times. This *more* than echoes how Baelor Breakspear's ""nose looked as though it had been broken more than once"". (tHK) Again, Baelor was a maternal Martell, the son of *Mariah Martell* and Daeron Targaryen, who were respectively sister to Maron Martell and brother to Daenerys Targaryen, who together begat modern day House Martell.

##Marwyn The Figurative Giant
Marwyn's is ""squat"" and ""stocky"", implying short, sturdy legs and a certain thickness. Together with his ""too big"" head ""thrust[ing] forward from his shoulders""; his ""bull's neck"", his ""dockside thug"" look, his ""heavy… chest and shoulders""; his ""rock-hard ale belly"" (i.e. ""lower torso"") so big it is ""straining at the laces of the leather jerkin he wore""; his beetled brow; his huge hands which compare to Morgarth's ""hands as large as hams"" and imply huge feet; and his addiction to a substance, he sounds suspiciously like a small *giant*. Consider:
&gt;…**[the giants'] lower torsos looked half again as wide as their upper.** Their **legs were shorter** than their arms, but **very thick**, and they wore no boots at all; their **feet were broad** splayed things…. **Neckless, their huge heavy heads thrust forward from between their shoulder blades**, and **their faces were squashed and brutal. Rats' eyes** no larger than beads were almost lost within folds of horny flesh…(SOS J II)
***
&gt;The giant… paw[ed] at his eyes with **hands as big as hams** to rub the sleep away… (DWD J VII)
***
&gt;Wun Wun had never tasted wine until he came to Castle Black, but once he had, he had taken a gigantic liking to it. (J IX)

As a maester, Marwyn is a ""grey rat"", and thus might even be said to have ""Rats' eyes"" like a giant. Meanwhile, Marwyn *looking* ""as if he were about to tear off someone's head"" prefigures Wun Wun the Giant *actually* tearing off Ser Patrek's arms while smashing his head. (DWD J XIII)

So what?

##A Figurative Marwyn vs. A Figurative Elder Brother
So, Marwyn being a figurative giant facilitates a nifty textual connection between him and Elder Brother—who, remember, ""looks more like a man made to *break bones* than to heal one""—via the main event of the pit-fighting matches Dany attends in Meereen:
&gt;**Goghor the Giant** would go against Belaquo **Bonebreaker.** (DWD Dae VIII)

Get it? ""The Giant"" (like Marwyn) against a Bonebreaker (like Elder Brother).

The connection goes farther. Marwyn has a ""bull's neck"", while his analogue Goghor the Giant ""looked more bull than man"". Better still, remember when Marwyn randomly mentions a ""Gorghan of Ghis""?
&gt;""**Gorghan of Old Ghis** once wrote that a prophecy is like a treacherous woman."" (FFC S V)

Gorghan of Ghis. Goghor the Giant. The similarity is unmistakable, *especially* in a book that sees a POV character idly muse about the similarity of the names Areo and Arys:
&gt;Ser Arys had come to Dorne to attend his own princess, as Areo Hotah had once come with his. Even their names sounded oddly alike: Areo and Arys. (FFC CotG)

##The Baelor Breakspear Parallels
Now that we've compared what we're told about Elder Brother, Morgarth and Marwyn with what we're told about Lewyn, Quentyn, Doran, Arianne and Oberyn, let's turn to the maternal Martell Prince Baelor ""Breakspear"" Targaryen, from *The Hedge Knight*, who TWOIAF ""codes"" as ""more Martell than Targaryen"". (TWOIAF) Many of the motifs surrounding Baelor are suspiciously mirrored and reworked by Elder Brother, just as we might expect if the two are secretly cousins, as they are if Elder Brother is Lewyn Martell, who is either the grandson or great-grandson of Prince Maron Martell and Daenerys Targaryen, whereas Baelor was the son of Maron's sister Mariah Martell and Daenerys's brother Daeron. Baelor also ""rhymes"" in certain respects with both Ser Morgarth and Marwyn, which makes sense if Elder Brother Lewyn is now Morgarth and if Marwyn is Lewyn's brother.

Consider the following litany of similarities, both in-world and textual. (Baelor quotes: tHK, TWOIAF)

- Baelor is a ""tall tall prince"" with ""long, *straight* legs""; Elder Brother is *""straight and tall""*. (Lewyn is ""tall as a tower.)

- Dunk's first thought upon seeing Baelor is that *""there was a weight to him, a sense of power and certainty""*. Despite his height, Baelor is physically thick enough that his adult son Valarr is clearly ""slimmer"" than Baelor is, despite being ""shorter"" as well. Clearly, then, Baelor is *large*. Upon seeing Elder Brother, Brienne's first thought is that he ""moved with the vigor of a man in the prime of his years"" and has about him a definite, *literally* powerful aura, in that *""He looks… like a man made to break bones""* and has knight ""written in his chest and shoulders"".
- TWOIAF says ""Baelor Breakspear was cut down *in his prime*""; Elder Brother is said to be ""*in the prime* of his years"".

- Baelor is called *""Breakspear""*. Elder Brother looks ""like a man made to *break bones*"".
- Baelor's *""nose looked as though it had been broken more than once""* and he's called ""the prince with the broken nose"". Marwyn's *""nose had been broken more than once""*, matching Baelor almost verbatim. Morgarth's nose is also ""broken"": it has ""broken veins"".
- Baelor's hair is ""dark and *peppered*"" and he is ""clean-shaven"", a funhouse-mirror version of Morgarth with his ""thick salt-and-pepper beard"" and of Elder Brother with his explicitly shaved scalp that is nonetheless as ""as stubbly as his heavy jaw"".
- Just as Baelor does not look like Dunk expects him to look—
    &gt;He does not look a Targaryen in truth, with that dark hair.

    —so Elder Brother does not look like Brienne expects him to look:
    &gt;""The Elder Brother was not what Brienne had expected. He could hardly be called *elder*… Nor did he have the gentle, kindly face she expected of a healer.""

    (Marwyn, of course, defies expectations similarly, looking ""more like a dockside thug than a maester"".)
- Despite appearances, Elder Brother *is* kind. He greets Brienne's group warmly. He speaks ""softly"". Baelor has a similar demeanor. He speaks to Dunk ""not unkindly"", and three times ""quietly"", recalling the ""Quiet Isle"".
- Baelor offers Dunk a drink by the light of a beeswax candle:
    &gt;**Baelor sat reading by the light of beeswax candle.** Dunk knelt before him. ""Rise,"" the prince said. **""Would you care for wine?""**

    Elder Brother unmistakably does the same:
    &gt;The cave that Brienne and her companions entered had been turned into a warm, snug sanctum. Woolen carpets covered the ground, tapestries the walls. **Tall beeswax candles gave more than ample light.**…

    &gt;**""You must be thirsty. Please, have some of our sweet cider** to wash the dust of travel from your throats."" [Elder Brother] poured for them himself.

    (Marwyn is, like Baelor, a reader, and his chamber is unmistakably lit by a very particular kind of ""candlelight"".)
- Both Elder Brother and Baelor are known for their ""hands"", so to speak: Elder Brother is a healer known for his *""healing hands""*, while Baelor was known as *""open-handed""*. Both men take actions embodying the other's notable hands: Elder Brother is open-handed—he welcomes Brienne, feeds her, and gives her shelter—while Baelor ""sent his own maester to tend [the wounded Humfrey Hardyng]."" (Marwyn is a maester himself.)
- It's explicitly said that Baelor is ""addressed… as brother"" by Maekar. Obviously Elder Brother is addressed as (elder) brother as well.
- Baelor makes Egg ask forgiveness of Dunk:
    &gt;""My uncle says I must humbly beg your forgiveness for deceiving you.""

    Elder Brother implies Sandor ""sought forgiveness"" of him, and tells Meribald:
    &gt;""Ser Quincy will ask you for forgiveness.""

- Dunk doesn't even begin to suspect who the avowedly Martell-looking Baelor is until it's spelled out for him, just as Dunk's descendant Brienne doesn't grok that Elder Brother is Lewyn.

It's apparent that some of the best hints of an in-world parallel between Baelor and Elder Brother consist in mostly/purely textual parallels. Taken as a whole, these parallels are too much to be certain coincidence.

To wit, the fare served at Elder Brother's table is ""plain, but very good"", which echoes how Baelor's garb is described here:
&gt;**Though he was dressed very plainly**, in green doublet, brown mantle, and scuffed boots, there was **a weight to him, a sense of power and certainty**.

Baelor dressing ""very plainly"" yet having ""a weight to him, a sense of power and certainty"" seems, in turn, to ""rhyme"" with Elder Brother's foregrounded, ""strange but simple"" furniture:
&gt;The furnishings were **strange but simple**…. All were made from driftwood, oddly shaped pieces **cunningly joined together** and **polished till they shone a deep gold in the candlelight.** (FFC B VI)

When we compare *that* description with this one of Baelor's garb the next day—
&gt;**Sunlight flashed golden off the shoulder clasp that held his cloak** and the slim coronet about his temples, **but otherwise he dressed far more simply than most of the other lords.**

—it's tough to escape the impression that GRRM is subtly linking Elder Brother to this Martell-Targaryen prince: Both scenes involve gold reflecting a light source, something being explicitly joined/held together, and a certain belying simplicity.

As previously discussed, the verbiage *""oddly shaped""* (which describes the wood from which Elder Brother's highlighted furniture is crafted) has only a couple analogues in the canon, two of which prove quite curious. First, there's a pair of ""oddly misshapen"" dragon skulls which happen to be compared with mastiffs—
&gt;The most recent were also the smallest; a matched pair no bigger than **mastiff's skulls**, and **oddly misshapen**, all that remained of the last two hatchlings born on Dragonstone. (GOT Ty II)

—thus recalling the misshapen skull (see: ""His head was too big for his body"") of Archmaester Marwyn, who is called ""the Mastiff"" and whom I am arguing is (a) Elder Brother's elder brother and (b) a Martell possessing the ""blood of the dragon"". Second, there's Bloodraven's ""odd-shaped… wine-stain"" birthmark—
&gt; Across his cheek and chin spread a **wine-stain birthmark** that was supposed to resemble a red raven, though Dunk only saw an **odd-shaped blotch** of discolored skin. (tSS)

—which is redolent of (a) Elder Brother (the owner of the *""oddly shaped""* furniture) saying his ""life was writ in red, in blood and wine"" and (b) Marwyn's sourleaf-stained teeth. Bloodraven himself is a non-Targaryen with ""dragon's blood"", like the Martells. Bloodraven once disguised himself as a hedge knight to infiltrate a tournament hosted by a former Master of Coin at a white castle, which just so happens to be exactly what I'm arguing Elder Brother Lewyn is doing now in the guise of Ser Morgarth the Merry.

##Maekar Targaryen, Maternal Martell
Like his brother Baelor Breakspear, Maekar Targaryen was Mariah Martell's son and the nephew of both Prince Maron Martell and Daenerys Targaryen, who were either grandparents or great-grandparents to Lewyn's generation of Martells. Like Baelor, Maekar exemplifies the fact that the Martells aren't all or even usually ""lithe"" like Oberyn and the salty Dornishmen in general. He also shows that they're not all tall like Baelor and Oberyn, either. As previously noted, Maekar is called ""stocky"", ""thickly built and powerful"", while Quentyn, who ""looks like"" Doran, is *verbatim* ""thickly built"" and ""stocky"". The match gives us every reason to suspect other Martells might take after Maekar (and/or his brother Baelor) in some respects.

A careful reading of *The Hedge Knight* hints that Maekar might in fact *look* like a Martell *to Dunk.* Consider how Dunk first sees Maekar:
&gt;""—more concerned if they were your sons, I'll wager,"" **an angry man** was saying as Dunk approached.

&gt;His straight hair and square-cut beard were so fair they seemed white in the dimness of the hall, but as he got closer he saw that they were in truth **a pale silvery color touched with gold.**

To *us*, Maekar's hair color may be a giveaway that he's a Targaryen. And a quick, blithe reading of the description of Maekar shortly after that (from Dunk's POV) *seems* to indicate that this is what Dunk thinks, too:
&gt;Thickly built and powerful, the prince—he was surely a prince—wore a leather brigandine covered with silver studs beneath a heavy black cloak trimmed with ermine.

""Surely a prince""? Surely, then, Dunk *knows* Maekar is a Targaryen, right? There's just one problem. Mere moments later, after it dawns on him that Maekar's interlocutor is Baelor Targaryen, he thinks the following:
&gt;Belatedly he recalled that the **stocky** man with the silver beard had addressed Prince Baelor as brother.

&gt;***He is blood of the dragon as well, damn me for a fool.* He could only be Prince Maekar, the youngest of King Daeron's four sons.**

Wait, what? Dunk identified Maekar as a prince right away, and a Targaryen prince is by definition ""blood of the dragon"", right? *So why is Dunk damning himself for a fool?* Might this be because Dunk first thought Maekar (who is the son of Mariah Martell, remember) was actually one of Maekar's first cousins: a son of Mariah's brother Prince Maron Martell and Maron's consort Daenerys Targaryen and thus a Prince, indeed? A Prince *of Dorne?*

I suspect the textual weirdness and Dunk's in-world confusion is there to impart a lesson to the reader: in ASOIAF, we'll meet *Martell* princes who are ""angry"", ""stocky"", ""thickly built and powerful"", like Maekar. And lo! Elder Brother has ""Knight… written in his chest and shoulders"" and lived an angry life ""writ in red""; ""Ser Morgarth"" is ""burly""; and Marwyn is ""short and squat"", ""heavy in the chest and shoulders"" with ""a bull's neck"", and looks ""as if he were about to tear off someone's head"", which certainly sounds angry, as does his ""brow beetl[ing]"" (per the ""scowling or sullen"" sense of ""beetle-browed""). Maekar-ish fits of anger are also a good way to get one's nose broken, like Marwyn's.

##The Lessons of Baelor and Maekar
As we've seen, it's impossible to read about the maternal Martells Baelor and Maekar and think any of them are ""lithe"" like the salty Dornishmen or ""slim"" and ""graceful"" like Oberyn. (SOS Ty V) Clearly both were big, powerful men. Given that the present Martells descend from Baelor and Maekar's mother's brother coupling with Baelor and Maekar's father's sister, and given the likewise ""thickly built"" physiques of Quentyn and thus Doran, it seems that Oberyn is something of an exception, and that most Martells have ""thick"", ""powerful"" bodies, *just as Marwyn and Morgarth/Elder Brother do*.

Note, too, that while Baelor was thought to look like his Martell mother, Dunk doesn't say that he is olive-skinned. This doesn't mean he wasn't; POVs omit details we think they ""should"" mention all the time—welcome to dramatic fiction—and olive skin can be subtle. That said, it seems likely that Dunk's silence means that Baelor *didn't* have olive skin, despite being ""more Martell than Targaryen"" and just as Martell as the proper ""Martells"" of his generation, if only because shortly before meeting Baelor Dunk comments on someone else's ""olive skin"" and Dornish look:
&gt;The puppeteer who worked the dragon was good to watch too; a tall drink of water, **with the olive skin and black hair of Dorne.** (tHK)

If this reading is correct, Baelor's not-olive skin imparts the same kind of lesson as the one demonstrated by Baelor and Maekar's physiques: not all ""Martells"" will be ""olive-skinned"". Again, this makes sense given that the Martells were co-founded by an Andal and have been forced to constantly make marriages of alliance with far flung, non-""salty"" houses.

(For what it's worth, I suspect that several generations ago the Martells were no longer particularly olive-skinned. I suspect that Doran's mother was preceded in rule by her *father,* who married a woman of considerable Rhoynish blood. I suspect that woman gave birth to Doran's mother but died sometime thereafter, and that Doran's mother's father remarried a less Rhoynish woman, who birthed Marwyn and Lewyn. But normal variance could also explain things.)

##Ser Uthor Underleaf As Martell-Connector
*Note: Even more than my arguments thus far, this section presupposes that GRRM has intentionally constructed ASOIAF as a kind of coded document which everywhere bursts with secrets, if only we know how to read it, in the conscious spirit of Joyce's* Ulysses *or Nabokov's* Pale Fire. *(It's thus no idle homage that Riverrun is called Riverrun [a la Joyce's* Finnegan's Wake*] or that ""pale fire"" is repeatedly seen in dreams and visions in ASOIAF [supernatural communication via dreams being a theme in* Pale Fire*] or that the decidedly morbid Dolorous Edd is so named [""Dolores Shade"" of Nabokov's* Lolita *being wordplay on the etymologically similar ""dolorous""].)*

I believe the descriptions of Ser Uthor Underleaf of *The Mystery Knight* constitute a kind of textual ""hub"" or ""signpost"" of Martell-associated motifs, implicitly verifying the linkage between (a) the ""secret"" Martells Elder Brother/Morgarth and Marwyn and (b) known Martells like Oberyn, Obara and Meria Martell. What do I mean?

Here's our main description of Ser Uthor:
&gt;""Indeed, ser,"" said one of their companions on the bench, a **sallow** man, **saturnine**, clad in **grey and green. His eyes were small and shrewd, set close together** beneath **thin arching brows.** A neat black beard framed his mouth, to make up for his **receding hair**. 

Uthor is ""sallow"". So was Princess Meria Martell, who reigned in Sunspear at the time of Aegon's conquest:
&gt;Meria Martell… was very fat, blind, and almost bald, **her skin sallow** and sagging. (TWOIAF)

Sallow complexions are classically associated with jaundice, which goes hand in hand with alcoholism (a la Elder Brother), but also with gout, a la Doran. This connection to gout and thus Doran is driven home by Uthor being ""saturnine"", inasmuch as it's virtually certain that Doran suffers from ""saturnine gout"" resulting from the use of lead acetate in his wine.

Ser Uthor being ""saturnine"" also recalls Oberyn Martell—
&gt;Beneath, [Oberyn's] face was lined and **saturnine**, with **thin arched brows** above large eyes as black and shiny as pools of coal oil. (SOS Ty V)

—whose ""thin arched brows"" just so happen to be the *sole* analogue in the canon to Uthor's ""thin arching brows"". (SOS Ty V) (Saturnine gout sufferer Doran's brother Oberyn being called ""saturnine"" in the first place is GRRM winking at us, telling us that he uses words to make connections *just like this.*) Uthor's black hair is ""receding"", which reworks this verbiage about Oberyn's ""lustrous black hair that *receded* from his brow"".

Uthor's eyes are ""set close together"", just as Obara Sand is twice said to have ""close-set eyes"". (FFC CotG; DWD tW) More on Obara below.

If we infer from Uthor's references to various known Martells that he's a kind of reservoir of Martell motifs, his ""shrewd"" eyes seem to affirm that the shrewd-eyed Elder Brother is a Martell. That they're ""small"" doesn't just hint that Elder Brother—like ravens and the people of Sunspear—has ""small black eyes"", as previously noted. It now seems to augur that Oberyn's ""large"" eyes and Arianne's ""big"" eyes are atypical—which makes sense if Oberyn gets his large eyes from his father and if Arianne didn't happen to inherit her big eyes from Doran.

##Grey and Green, White-Cloaked, Silent Sentinel-Soldiers
What about Uthor wearing ""grey and green""? That has nothing to do with House Martell, surely. Actually, those colors are *constantly* paired (16 times!) with ""grey-green sentinel trees"", which are in turn *constantly* paired with (16 more times!) with ""soldier pines"". As previously discussed, Arianne sees…
&gt;soldier pines that stood as **tall and straight as a tower** (WOW Ar II)

—a phrase which perfectly combines Elder Brother being ""straight and tall"" with Lewyn being ""tall as a tower"". She then references the ""silent trees"", nodding to Quiet Isle's vows of silence. Why does GRRM use grey-green *sentinel trees* to connect Uthor's colors to the ""tall and straight as a tower"" soldier pines? Or to put it another way, why are the soldier pines which sound so much like Elder Brother and Lewyn associated with sentinel trees? Because ""sentinels"" are *guards*, as in Kingsguards. To hammer the point, we read about *white-cloaked* soldier pines and sentinel trees:
&gt;Snowflakes drifted down soundlessly **to *cloak* the soldier pines and sentinels in white.** (DWD B III)

What was Lewyn, as a Kingsguard, if not a ""sentinel in white""? ADWD ultimately conflates sentinels and soldier pines completely, lest we get hung up on the distinction:
&gt;A warm fog hung in the air, **turning the trees into sentinels, tall soldiers** shrouded in cloaks of gloom. (DWD GiW)

Those sentinel trees, by the way, are the very first thing ASOIAF calls ""stubborn"":
&gt;This was a wood of **stubborn sentinel trees** armored in **grey-green** needles, of mighty oaks, of **ironwoods** as old as the realm itself. (GOT C I)

And what does Selmy say about Dornishmen, specifically as regards a Martell?
&gt;""**Dornishmen are notoriously stubborn, Your Grace. Prince Quentyn's forebears** fought your own for the better part of two hundred years. He will not go without you."" (DWD Dae VIII)

Notice the rhyme: stubborn Quentyn is surrounded by Yronwoods, the stubborn sentinels by ""ironwoods"".

##Uthor, Baelor and Elder Brother
A second description of Ser Uthor—
&gt;Underleaf's garments were of good cloth, clean and well cared for, but simply cut. A silver clasp in the shape of a snail fastened his cloak.

—likewise bolsters my earlier analysis. As a whole, it blatantly echoes this description of the maternal Martell Baelor Breakspear—
&gt;Sunlight flashed golden off the shoulder clasp that held his cloak and the slim coronet about his temples, but otherwise he dressed far more simply than most of the other lords.

—a passage we already saw connected to Elder Brother. Note, too, how Uthor's clothing being *""simply cut""* but *""of good cloth""* rhymes with the food served at the table of the Baelor-esque Elder Brother, i.e. Lewyn Martell:
&gt;The food was plain, but very good;

Lest there be any doubt that the connections I've drawn are real, compare Uthor here (and note who he talks about)—
&gt;**Ser Uthor seated himself and stretched his legs out. ""Prince Baelor** was well loved.""

—with ""Prince Baelor"" himself, here:
&gt;**Even seated**, he looked to be a head taller than the other, to judge from the long straight **legs stretched out before him.**

To be absolutely clear: my broad point is not that Uthor is related to the Martells, in-world. It's that *textually,* he links the known Martells Meria, Oberyn, Doran, and Obara to the secret Martell Elder Brother Lewyn by embodying traits possessed by each of them and by simultaneously referencing both the half-Martell Baelor and Quiet Isle.

##Brown and Dun (Again) and Hemp.
This phenomenon goes beyond Uthor's personal physical traits. His ""dun-colored"" tourney tent, staked to the ground with ""hempen ropes"", reminds us of Sunspear (""brown and dun"") and its ""dun-colored Sandship"", and also the brothers of the Quiet Isle, whose robes are ""brown-and-dun"" and presumably tied with the same ""hempen ropes"" we see various other holy brothers' robes tied with, thus further underscoring the connection between the Martells and the Quiet Isle. (FFG CotG; Jai I; B VI; COK Ty V)

##Oberyn-ish Uthor
Uthor arrogantly boasts of his prowess—
&gt;""I am a tourney knight, the best that you are ever like to meet.""

&gt;""The best?"" His arrogance made Dunk angry. 

—in a way that recalls Oberyn's arrogance shortly before he dies:
&gt;Prince Oberyn was unimpressed. ""I have killed large men before. The trick is to get them off their feet. Once they go down, they're dead."" The Dornishman sounded so blithely confident that Tyrion felt almost reassured…
***
&gt;""You are going to fight that?"" Ellaria Sand said in a hushed voice.

&gt;**""I am going to kill that,"" her lover replied *carelessly*.** (SOS Ty X)

Uthor's knowing, amused demeanor—
&gt;The Snail looked amused.

—mirrors Oberyn's:
&gt;The prince's eyes were dark with amusement.

##Marwyn and Uthor
This passage—
&gt;""**Get out of my sight.** This good knight and I have matters to discuss."" [Uthor said.]

&gt;Will **wasted no time** in scrambling from the tent. **""Have a seat,"" Ser Uthor said politely. ""Will you take wine?""**

—reworks two motifs from Marwyn Martell's story: First, Marwyn ordering Sam and Alleras *in* to his chambers—
&gt;""**Get in here**, Slayer,"" growled the man in the doorway. ""And you, Sphinx. Now.""

—and second, how Marywn…
&gt;""…is not a man who believes in **wasting time**."" (FFC S V)

Uthor's invitation to sit and drink recalls Elder Brother Lewyn offering Brienne cider as she sits with him in his cottage, while it plays with Baelor offering Dunk wine after telling him to *rise*:
&gt;Dunk knelt before him. **""Rise,"" the prince said. ""Would you care for wine?""**

##Uthor on Gallant Princes
Quentyn attempts some ""gallantry"" (pointedly recalling Meribald's reference to a ""gallant prince"" and Sansa calling Morgarth ""gallant"")—
&gt;""My marriage need not be the end of all your hopes. I know why you are here.""

&gt;""For you,"" said Quentyn, **all awkward gallantry.** (DWD Dae VIII)

—for which Uthor happens to have the perfect reply:
&gt;Ser Uthor laughed. ""Is that gallantry I smell, or just stupidity? (tMK)

##""Uthor""
The name ""Uthor Underleaf"", by the way, has some interesting Martell-ish resonances which are consistent with the idea that Uthor is a walking code identifying Elder Brother, Morgarth and Marwyn as Martells. There are two other Uthors in the canon. One is, like Marwyn, a maester. His sole appearance is in reference to a situation—
&gt;""Ramsay killed him. A sickness of the bowels, Maester Uthor says, but I say poison."" (DWD R III)

—paralleling that which many suspect is afflicting Tywin when Tyrion kills him: i.e. a poisoning of the bowels we're nudged to believe was *Oberyn's* doing.

The other Uthor is shoehorned into a discussion of the founder of the Citadel, which Oberyn attended and where his daughter ""Alleras"" is an acolyte in their uncle Marwyn's service:
&gt;The origins of the Citadel are almost as mysterious as those of the Hightower itself. **Most credit its founding to the second son of Uthor** of the High Tower… (TWOIAF)

What else does TWOIAF tell us about second sons founding things? That Oberyn rode with *the* Second Sons ""before *founding* his own [free] company.""

##""Underleaves""
The word ""Underleaf"" naturally reminds us of the idiom ""*turning over* a new leaf"", which refers to beginning anew, fresh. This is, of course, exactly what Elder Brother Lewyn Martell did after ""dying"" at the Ruby Ford.

""Underleaf"" is also a real world noun. It refers to a certain kind of ""leaf"" found on plants called ""liverworts"", a fact which suggests my reading of Uthor is correct in two respects. First, the ""leaves"" of a liverwort *are not true leaves*: they just look like leaves, much as Uthor is probably not a Martell, but rather someone who shares Martell motifs. Second, ""liverworts"" were named because they were believed to cure diseases of the liver. So what? So, where do you think ""sallow"" Meria Martell, ""the Yellow Toad of Dorne"", got her name? From her yellow skin. Why do people develop jaundiced yellow skin? *Because of liver disease.* Which comes from drinking too much, like Elder Brother, Oberyn and Arianne. Let's also mention: *toads* are thought to cause (ahem) ""worts"". So to speak.

Lest you don't think GRRM knows this, ""liverwort"" makes an appearance in TWOIAF in TWOW, where it's listed along with lungwort and hornwort. It just so happens to be part of *Arianne Martell's* second POV chapter (where it's part of a very elaborate, not-yet-discussed parallel to Quiet Isle which once again hints at the Martell living there).

##""Underleaf"" Cider Apples
There's *more* in the name ""Underleaf"", though. It has a second, archaic meaning:
&gt;2. (obsolete) A prolific kind of cider apple. (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/underleaf)

Underleafs were cider apples! As in the very apples we see Oberyn's daughter ""Alleras"" shoot in the *AFFC Prologue*, before s/he drinks ""fearsomely strong cider"" and leads Sam to Marwyn. *Any* reference to apples, of course, conjures the idiom ""the apple doesn't fall from the tree"", a reference to the similarities children bear to their parents, and thus to family trees and lineage: just the things Uthor helps us expose.

""Uthor Underleaf"", indeed.

(By the way, the fact that Uthor is the ""Snail Knight"" doesn't hurt my case. ""Frogs and snails and puppy dog tails"" is one version of an elementally famous nursery rhyme line, ""frog"" being Quentyn's Martells nickname and Dog wagging his tail repeatedly on and around Quiet Isle. That said, Uthor's Snail epithet tells us something juicier about Martell secrets. But that's a story for another day.)

##Obara of Oldtown
Let's talk about Obara, whose eyes are ""close-set"", much as Uthor's eyes are ""set close together."" I believe it's fairly obvious that she was sired by Marywn, not Oberyn.

The repeated emphasis on her *rat*-brown hair—
&gt;Obara was the eldest Sand Snake, a **big-boned** woman near to thirty, with the **close-set eyes and rat-brown hair** of the Oldtown whore who'd birthed her. (FFC CotG)
***
&gt;Obara, rusted nails and boiled leather, with her **angry, close-set eyes** and **rat-brown** hair. (DWD tW)

—recalls Barbrey Dustin's rant in which she calls maesters ""grey rats"" and talks of them fathering bastards:
&gt;"" Walys Flowers had… an archmaester of the Citadel for a father, it was rumored. The grey rats are not as chaste as they would have us believe. Oldtown maesters are the worst of all."" (DWD PoW)

Surely these words have some dramatic payoff. How ""chaste"" is ""Oldtown maester"" Marwyn? Not very, judging by the lascivious way he talks about prophecy:
&gt;""Gorghan of Old Ghis once wrote that a prophecy is like a treacherous woman. She takes your member in her mouth, and you moan with the pleasure of it and think, how sweet, how fine, how good this is . . . and then her teeth snap shut and your moans turn to screams."" (FFC S V)

Actually, Barbrey's monologue encodes the idea that Marwyn is *exactly* the sort of not-so-chaste, bastard-spawning ""Oldtown maester"" she is talking about, in that the very next sentence—
&gt;""Oldtown maesters are the worst of all. Once [Walys] forged his chain, his secret father and his friends **wasted no time** dispatching him to Winterfell…"" (DWD Pow)

—*directly* recalls what ""Alleras"" says about Oldtown Maester Marwyn:
&gt;""The Mage is not a man who believes in **wasting time**."" (FFC S V)

With his thick, squat body, his ""slab of a jaw"" and his oversized skull, Marwyn is surely as ""big-boned"" as Obara (albeit shorter, which I'll discuss below), whereas Oberyn is ""slim"" and ""slender"". (SOS Ty V; IX) At present Marwyn is old enough that ""bristly white hair sprouted from his ears and nostrils"", whereas Oberyn was probably 12 years old and living in Sunspear when Obara was conceived in Oldtown. (I'll discuss the timeline shortly.)

Eight more clues convince me Obara is Marwyn's daughter, not Oberyn's (and that Hotah likely knows this).

First, Obara has distinctly ""close-set"" eyes. Hotah thinking…
&gt;All of Prince Oberyn's daughters have his viper eyes, Hotah realized suddenly. The color does not matter.

…has never really jibed with Obara's eyes being so clearly detailed in a way that doesn't sound anything like Oberyn's nor her supposed sisters, *color aside.* Oberyn's eyes are ""large… pools of coal oil"". Tyene's eyes are called ""deep blue pools"" just before Hotah has his epiphany. Surely eyes that are ""deep pools"" are not small, so viper eyes seem to entail both size and liquidity. There's no mention of either as regards Obara, but Nym's eyes are ""large and lustrous"", which sounds like much the same thing. (Lustrous implies a shine, which comports with the liquid quality of Oberyn's and Tyene's eyes.) What's more, a literal viper's eyes are *the opposite* of ""close-set"". To the contrary, they're set very far apart relative to human eyes. I suspect Hotah knows the truth of Obara's paternity, and that his epiphany after seeing first Obara, *then* Oberyn's actual daughters Nymeria and Tyene, is a subtle allusion to this (and to another family secret I'll discuss later).

Second, Obara's eyes are ""angry"". While we are told naught of Marwyn's eyes, we *are* told that his ""brow beetled"". This can have several meanings. Per dictionary.com, one of them is that he was *""scowling or sullen""*, an impression easily conveyed by someone with ""angry"" eyes. And indeed, look what Obara does, just like ""dad"":
&gt;[Obara]… sat there **sullen and scowling**, neither smiling nor speaking. (DWD tW)

Third, Obara is called ""prickly"" and ""hot-tempered"". (FFC CotG) Certainly the Red Viper lives for vengeance, so this *could* fit. In truth, though, Oberyn's demeanor is general calm and smirking. His flaws are arrogance, over-confidence, and vanity more than ""seeing red"" in the heat of the moment. Indeed, he attempts to goad The Mountain into losing *his* temper. Marwyn, on the other hand, wears an obvious badge of being a ""prickly, hot-tempered"" sort of man: his oft-broken nose suggests he's been punched in the face many times, which is just the sort of thing that somehow befalls ""prickly, hot-tempered"" people.

Fourth, a bit of whimsical wordplay. Consider: We're told ""Obara *bristled*"", while Marwyn's ""*Bristly* white hair sprouted"" and his (""bristly""?) ""brow beetled"". (DWD tW; FFC S V)

Fifth, (and here things get *real*) Obara's mother explicitly doubted that Oberyn was her father:
&gt;""'She is a girl,' she said, 'and **I do not think that she is yours.** I had a thousand other men.'"" (FFC CotG)

Sixth, Obara's mother is an ""Oldtown whore"". Marwyn literally ""kept company with whores"" —
&gt;The Mage was not like other maesters. People said that **he kept company with whores** and hedge wizards… (FFC Prologue)

—and hung out not just in ""brothels"", but, we're told in the same breath, in ""rat pits"":
&gt;Men spoke of seeing [Marwyn] down in the undercity, **in rat pits and black brothels**…

Rat pits, as in Obara's repeatedly ""rat brown"" hair.

Seventh, Arianne says Obara is ""so fierce"". (DWD tW) While Oberyn is also ""so fierce"", what else are fierce according to our text? (FFC CotG) Mastiffs—
&gt;""**Gallant**, that son of mine, and **fierce as a mastiff**."" (COK B II)

—like Marwyn ""the mastiff"", who ""looked more like a mastiff than a maester"". (FFC S V; Pro) (Note *another* reference to ""gallant"", the word Sansa applies to Morgarth, who I believe is Marwyn the Mastiff's brother Lewyn.)

Finally, Oberyn's and Obara's very *names* suggest that he adopted her. GRRM loves Shakespeare, and ""Oberon"" is the King of Faeries in *A Midsummer Night's Dream.* Much of the drama revolves around Oberon wanting to raise a ""changeling"" stolen from his true parents as his own son in order to make the boy his ""henchman"". Sounds a lot Oberyn and Obara, doesn't it?

The *one* detail about Obara that makes her seem more Oberyn's daughter than Marwyn's is the fact that she is explicitly ""long-legged"". Oberyn is ""tall, slim"" and takes notably ""long strides"", implying he has long legs, whereas Marwyn is ""short and squat"". (FFC CotG; SOS Ty V, X) That said, the text just so happens to give us an example of a Martell whose height is attributed entirely to her *mother*—
&gt;Where the Sand Snakes were tall, Arianne took after her mother, who stood but five foot two. (CotG)

—so despite her height and long legs, I am confident Obara is Marwyn's daughter by a long-legged whore.

##Obara and the Martell Timeline
A look at the timeline doesn't rule out the possibility that Oberyn sired Obara, but it does show that Oberyn was *very* young when Obara was conceived. Obara is 28 in *very* early 300 AC, per the AFFC Appendix. (AFFC actually begins in late 299, with Obara's first appearance likely taking place c. ""January"" 300. I am assuming the beginning of her story is the reference point for the appendix.) At the absolute latest, then, she was born c. early ""January"" 272 and conceived c. ""April"" 271. On the other hand, if she turned 28 back in late ""January"" of 299 (such that she is almost 29 when we meet her), she was conceived c. ""April"" 270. The evidence suggests Oberyn was only 11 and 12 at those times. How so?

Doran is ""two-and-fifty"" at the outset of AFFC, c. ""January"" 300. He casually states that there are ""ten years between [he and Oberyn]"", which doubles down on Tyrion thinking Oberyn is ""ten years too young"" to be Doran in ASOS Ty V. (FFC CotG) Thus one might posit that Doran was born in mid-247, and Oberyn in mid-257, which would mean Oberyn was at minimum *almost* 13 when Obara was conceived. That's what most folks seem to do. So what's the problem?

The problem is Oberyn's statement that he was (only) ""oh, fourteen, fifteen, thereabouts"" in 273 AC. (SOS Ty V) If Oberyn is really almost *exactly* 10 years younger than Doran—a dubious notion many assume without comment—then regardless of exactly when Doran was born between January 247 and January 248, we would expect Oberyn to instead say he was ""fifteen, sixteen"" in 273, given that almost every possible birthday per Oberyn being *exactly* 10 years younger than Doran would see him as 15 turning 16 that year. Yet for some reason GRRM decided to have Oberyn say he was a year younger.

We can happily marry everything we're told per the following scenario, which merely assumes Doran and Tyrion are (gasp!) rounding-off when they say Oberyn is ""ten years"" younger than Doran: (a) Doran was born in very late 247 or in early ""January"" 248, and (b) Oberyn is close to 10*½* years Doran's junior, having been born c. April/May/June 258. This would mean Oberyn was 14 turning 15 in mid-273, *perfectly matching what he tells Tyrion*. It would also mean Oberyn was less than 13 years-old when Obara was conceived between April 270 and April 271. Yes, this is still old enough for a precocious boy to father a child, but it's also young enough to invite suspicion, especially given the way the ""obvious"" timeframe suggested by ""ten years"" and ""two-and-fifty"" encourages us to think Oberyn was a year or so older at the time.

My best guess is this: Sometime in mid-late 270—perhaps for his 12th birthday—Oberyn visited his Uncle Marwyn in Oldtown. Marwyn decided to make a man of his nephew, while partaking of the same ""Oldtown whore"" himself. (I suspect he may well have been a ""regular"" who had and would continue to develop a relationship with the woman.) When Obara was born, Marwyn's vow of celibacy made it at best highly problematic for him to claim her as his own—and in any case there is no DNA testing in Westeros. At a certain point, Oberyn decided to step in and ""do the right thing"" on behalf of his uncle. Obara's mother drank herself to death—perhaps as much because *the wrong man* took her daughter as anything else: a man she did not love or know as she did Marwyn.

##The Dwarf Brother Signpost
I believe Uthor Underleaf is just one of many characters whose descriptions are largely *contrived* in order to link together traits possessed by various public and/or secret Martells. Another such ""signpost"" is Brienne's dwarf holy brother, whose description connects Marwyn, Elder Brother and Ser Morgarth, while suggesting they are ""all"" (i.e. both) Martells.

Here he is:
&gt;Not until he hopped off the bench did Brienne realize that the speaker was a dwarf. The little man was not quite five feet tall. **His nose was veined and bulbous, his teeth red from sourleaf**, and he was dressed in the **brown roughspun robes of a holy brother**, with **the iron hammer of the Smith dangling down about his thick neck.**

&gt;""Keep your seat,"" she said. ""I can stand as well as you.""

&gt;""**Aye**, but my head is not so apt to knock upon the ceiling."" **The dwarf's speech was coarse but courteous. Brienne could see the crown of his scalp where he had shaved it. Many holy brothers wore such tonsures.** (FFC B II)

The dwarf's ""veined and bulbous"" nose combines words used to describe the noses of Ser Morgarth—
&gt;a red nose **bulbous** with broken veins

—and Elder Brother—
&gt;his nose **veined** and red

—who are one and the same.

The dwarf is a ""holy brother"" like Elder Brother, and his tonsure and shaved scalp are called out, as are Elder Brother's—
&gt;Though he wore a tonsure, his scalp was as stubbly as his heavy jaw.

—while his ""coarse but courteous"" speech parallels Morgarth's manner, right down to both men's first word being ""Aye"":
&gt;""**Aye,"" said [Morgarth]…. ""You left out that part, m'lord.""** (FFC Ala II)

""M'lord"" is inherently courteous, but also lowborn, ""coarse"" speech. (Lewyn, like Sandor, knows how to sound common, unlike Theon.) Lest we miss the parallel to Morgarth, the dwarf likewise calls Brienne ""m'lady"". 

The dwarf's teeth are ""red from sourleaf"" like Marwyn's—
&gt;sourleaf had stained [Marwyn's] teeth a mottled red…

—and later he smiles a ""red smile"" like Marwyn:
&gt;Marywn smiled a ghastly smile, the juice of the sourleaf running red between his teeth.

The spotlight on the holy dwarf's neck and necklace—
&gt;…the iron hammer of the Smith dangling down **about his thick neck**.

—likewise parallels the one on Marwyn's:
&gt;Marwyn wore a chain of many metals **around his bull's neck.**

Meanwhile, the ""iron hammer of the Smith"" hanging from the dwarf's neck recalls the same thing hanging from the neck of the eldest survivor of the Brave Companions' rape of a septry in ASOS:
&gt;The eight brown brothers watched with resignation. They were all that remained, explained **the eldest, who wore a small iron hammer on a thong about his neck** to signify his devotion to the Smith.

Seriously, if you're going to kill and resurrect a character there needs to be a better reason than keeping everyone on a cliffhanger until the next book / season. When Gandalf died there was a purpose to it, so that the Fellowship would have to fend for themselves without his help. And it's established in the world of Middle-earth that Ainur can't really die either and Gandalf is an Ainur. And I know what you're gonna say that people have died and been resurrected in ASOIAF before Jon Snow. Yeah I know but when you can just kill people and bring em back there's no tension anymore. It's like in Kings man when Harry gets shot in the frickin head and is then resurrected. After that happens they just start shooting people in the head and resurrected them all over the place.

0,1,0,16,11,"It is a sci-fi standard to consider time as the 4th dimension. Beings which exist within or outside of the 4th dimension have made their way into lots of sci-fi stories, notably the heptapods of “Story of Your Life” by Ted Chiang (the short story *Arrival* is based on) and *Interstellar*. There are some comparisons that can be drawn between these works and the weirwoods of ASOIAF.

*\*\*Spoilers for “Story of Your Life” and* Arrival*: In “Story of Your Life,” time has almost no bearing on the heptapods’ perception: what they know, they have always known, what they’ve done they’ll always have done. Any action the heptapods do is purely performative—knowing the future impels them to perform this future.*

What I’ve been thinking about lately are the weirwoods are beings existing outside of the confines of time. Perhaps, like the heptapods, what they know they’ve always known, as time has so little bearing on them. This is how Bran &amp; Brynden Rivers see the past, present, and future, and perhaps why the future is harder to see: they can scan through the whole collective knowledge of the weirwoods to pinpoint the knowledge that they seek. The future would be more difficult to divine because there are so many variables involved in each future event that the greenseer, as a linear 3D being constrained by a linear perception of time, may lack sufficient knowledge to pinpoint the knowledge that they seek.

For example, Bran can see his father at Winterfell, because he knows the where, a general idea of the when, and the who. In the show, he can likewise see the Tower of Joy because it’s a defined place, in a defined time period, again, with a defined who. However, seeing the outcome of the War for the Dawn, for example, would require him to know the where, the when, and the who, and there are so many variables that he’d have a harder time pinpointing that. He wouldn’t know that Jon or Daenerys would be significant in this battle. He wouldn’t know where it would happen, or when in the future it would happen. Without these crucial bits of information, he’d have to scan a near-infinite number of possibilities to come to this knowledge.

That would also explain why the visions of the greenseers are image-based: trees don’t speak; they’d communicate ideas through images that they would understand (like a chained wolf).

I theorize, also, that there are other 4D beings, like the nightshade trees at the House of the Undying, perhaps even the undying themselves (if they’re like a twisted version of the Singers attached to the weirwood net), maybe even glass candles. It’s conceivable that fire, in this magical universe, would have  similar properties. After all, while individual flames can be put out, energy itself is never created nor destroyed, but simply changes form and disperses.

Thoughts?

Edit: I just re-listened to a couple of Bran chapters and, I believe in his last one from ADwD, there are some quotes that somewhat back this up, but mainly

""Time is different for a tree than for a man. Sun and soil and water, these are the things a weirwood understands, not days and years and centuries. For men, time is a river. We are trapped in its flow, hurtling from past to present, always in the same direction. The lives of trees are different. They root and grow and die in one place, and that river does not move them. The oak is the acorn, the acorn is the oak.""

1. This quote makes really clear that the ""river of time"" does not have an effect on trees. Time does not move forward for them, time just is.

2. ""The oak is the acorn, the acorn is the oak"" suggests that past, present, and future have no bearing on a tree; that their life cycles and periods are near-interchangeable.

Both lead me back to that thought: what they know, they have always known and will always know. If the acorn is the tree, what is the boundary between what the tree has seen and the sapling? Perhaps none.

And does that knowledge base ripple outward as sacrifices are made and weirwoods are nourished by flesh? For example, the Faceless Men's skin masks retain some memory that the assassins see when first entering that skin. Can weirwoods absorb memories in a smiliar way when feeding on the skin, flesh and blood of people and animals, thus extending that knowledge network?

This can provide some explanation for why they said that Bran will soon be able to see past the weirwoods: it all becomes part of the same network, as ""souls"" decompose into the ground, and then shared across root systems of trees and plants.",1,"(Spoilers Extended) A thought about weirwoods, time, prophecy",4554,61

First, I think it's most likely that he would have killed the them all. This means he would have been with Arya from that point on.  Im guessing he would be able to smuggle her out of the city, get her on a ship somehow, and sail her to white harbour. She would be returned home and be at Winterfell for the Theons sacking. Then, she would either go with Bran to the wall or Rickon to Skagos.

But back south there would be a lot of other changes. She would not be around to help the Northmen capture Harenhall. Without the early capture Harenhall, it is likely that Vargo Hoat wouldn't have around to capture Jaime and Brienne, and Jaime would still have his hand.

Also, with the death of ser Meryn Trant, there would be an open spot on the Kingsguard for the Hound. Without the need to open up a spot, Ser Barristan may still remain as Lord Commander. He would never go east to help Danearys, and she might die in Quarth from the Assasins.

# 1) Changes

Before adding the characters introducted in *Fire &amp; Blood*, I had to make minor changes:

* Alyn Velaryon was noted twice (once as Alyn of Hull and once as Alyn Velaryon), I fixed it.
* I added some characters I had forget (only a few).
* I changed some years of birth which were incorrect.

Also I realised that putting ""Unnamed"" everytime a character's name is not given is redundant and a little bit dull. What I did instead was to add a column called ""Category"" to classifed four type of characters:

1. Named characters
2. Nicknamed characters
3. Unnamed noble characters (UN)
4. Unnamed smallfolk characters (US)

The distinction between UN and US is sometimes difficult to make, for example hedge knights; some are noble, some are smallfolk who got knighted. In the end, I decided to put all knights and squires as nobles.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, my goal for creating statistics sheets in the first place was to represent people who lived on ""Planetos"" as best as I could. However, the unnamed characters don't bring a lot of information for that. Therefore this time I put the emphasis on named characters.

Speaking of names, u/Bookshelfstud you talked about my last update on *Maester Monthly* which was great thank you. In the episode you said you were surprised by the number of different forenames GRRM had included in his world. There are now **2084 different forenames** on ""Planetos"". Especially for you Michael, here are the new ones. Enjoy!

* The 41 new female forenames in the canon are:

Alarra, Amanda, Amarys, Beatrice, Cassandra, Clarice, Coryanne, Edyth, Elenda, Elinda, Elissa, Florence, Floris, Hazel, Henrietta, Jennis, Jessamyn, Jirelle, Karolyn, Larissa, Lianna, Lucinda, Mara, Marra, Maryam, Melony, Moriah, Myrmadora, Patricia, Perianne, Priscella, Prudence, Prunella, Rue, Samantha, Sansara, Sharis, Tyshara, Violante, Yrma and Ysabel.

* The 91 new male forenames in the canon are:

Abelon, Agramore, Alastor, Alec, Alfador, Amaury, Amos, Anselm, Arnold, Baldrick, Bambarro, Barquen, Bendamure, Benton, Bernard, Bertrand, Borys, Braxton, Bryndemere, Bywin, Cameron, Clegg, Crey, Culiper, Darnold, Donald, Drako, Eldric, Elysar, Emerick, Emory, Erwin, Fredo, Garmon, Garon, Garrick, Gedmund, **George**, Goodwyn, Guyle, Herman, Humphrey, Isembard, Jonah, Jordan, Julian, Kyrie, Leowyn, Lorence, Lyonce, Malentine, Matteno, Mattheus, Morion, Moslander, Norman, Ollidar, Olyver, Orryn, Oscar, Oswald, Oswyck, Owain, Pereno, Prentys, Raylon, Regis, Rego, Rhogar, Roggerio, Rollo, Ronnal, Rowley, Roy, Ryben, Rymond, Samgood, Sandeman, Sandoq, Silvario, Sly, Smike, Stanton, Thoron, Tigaro, Torgen, Toron, Torreo, Umbert, Ummet and Wyland.

# Death count in wars

Given that *Fire &amp; Blood* ends with the ***Dance of the Dragons*** and its aftermath, I had the idea of counting how many people died in the conflict and compare it to ***Robert's Rebellion*** and the ***War of the Five Kings***.

I assemble all the characters for which we have a concret year of death occuring during these conflict into a table:

https://i.redd.it/tocwk32wvp221.jpg

**Note:** Some of these conflicts are shorter than others.

* **The Dance of the Dragons** occured from Viserys's death on 3^(rd) day of the 3^(rd) moon of 129 AC (aka 3/3/129AC) to Aegon III and Jaehaera Targaryen's wedding on the 7^(th) day of the 7^(th) moon of 131 AC (aka 7/7/131AC). That's **28 months of war.**
* **Robert's Rebellion** occured from the abduction of Lyanna Stark (early in 282 AC) to the Sack of King's Landing (in 283 AC). Apparently the conflict lasted **about a year**.
* **The War of the Five Kings** is not yet finished and began after Robert Baratheon's death for which we don't have a precise date. If I follow [this timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZsY3lcDDtTdBWp1Gx6mfkdtZT6-Gk0kdTGeSC_Dj7WM/edit#gid=8), the conflict would be from December 298 AC to now (around August 300 AC), **20 months of war** so far (shorter than the Dance).

I was surprised how quickly I was able to do this update. I can already promise you the TWOW update will take a lot more time than that when it would be its turn. But it will be done eventually (TWOW and other(s) ASOIAF books).

A man can dream and he has dreamed of publishing pattern: October 2017 *Sons of the Dragons*, November 2018 *Fire &amp; Blood Volume 1* and December 2019 *The Winds of Winter*. Hopefully I'm not too wrong about this (sweet summer child).

&amp;#x200B;

Now that this spreadsheet update is done, I would like to do some new family trees with the information we got from *Fire and Blood* but I don't know how to do it. Do some of you know of an easy way to create stuff like that (site, software, ...) ? I'm open to suggestion. Thank you.",1,(Spoilers Extended) Spreadsheet of ALL ASOIAF CHARACTERS!

I have never really felt that he was a particulary good politician, he seemed to be far better at following others' ideas at the Small council and at looking like a good councilman than at making real decisions. 

Also during his short reign as ""King"" in the Stormlands and the Reach he could have seized the occasion to strike the vulnerable King's Landing to take the city and the Iron Throne but instead waited for the Stark and Lannister's armies to wear each other down and his plan against Stannis at Storm's End didn't seem to be more elaborated than just big charges of cavalry which makes me feel that he isn't a very good general.

I find it quite interesting how the stature or fortunes of different houses rise and fall during the Targaryen dynasty and ASOIAF series.

When you read about the first 150 years of Targaryen reign, house Stark is barely involved at all. They are just freezing and starving up in the cold north. I think they only get involved twice during this period, when Torrhen Stark bends the knee and when Cregan Stark becomes the Hand during hour of the wolf. But Starks are at the centre of ASOIAF series.

Conversely house Velaryon is definitely number 2 during the initial conquest seeing how close they are in appearance and relations to the Targaryens, not to mention all the inter marriages. They are also the strongest naval power among Westeros perhaps rivalled only by the Greyjoys/Ironborn. Redwynes come in at number 3 in naval power. Dorn is perhaps fourth. But then Velaryons are nobodys during the ASOIAF series.

While house Hightower isn't that special at all during ASOIAF  but they overtake Velaryons during Fire &amp; Blood. At the same time their liege lords Tyrells are barely involved at all (perhaps people of the time still thought them stewards rather than worth replacements of Gardeners). Another of Tyrells' bannermen, the Redwynes also seems more powerful/prestigious than them during Fire &amp; Blood.

The Baratheons are perhaps most consistent, almost never losing relevance only to become usurpers at the end. Lannisters are central to ASOIAF but still ok-ish important during Fire &amp; Blood.

Darklyns, Strongs get wiped out at different points.

I don't think it makes sense for the show to end in some big battle between the living and the dead, the white walkers vs John and Danny, fighting with their obsidian and dragons and somehow winning in the end. 

GoT isn't a traditional fantasy novel, and we know that GRRM like to subvert the traditional fantasy tropes. 

IMHO it makes more sense for John to make peace with the WW, he'll 'bend the knee' to the WW because it's the right thing to do for the realm instead of fighting for his pride and 'honor' so to speak.

It's a reoccurring motif  in John's story too. For example, he makes peace with the Wildlings after he becomes commander of the Night's Watch (against the advice of many people). He similarly made peace with Danny (again something that many people are going to be unhappy about and cautioned against) and tried make an alliance with Cerci. 

Sure at first they fight it out, big battle and it's all very exciting (probably episode 3?). But in the end the White Walkers win, and they move on south. Stuff happens, John realizes there is no way to win this militarily, but that maybe a truce or agreement can be made. I imagine it will probably involve some kind of blood magic, maybe someone needs to die to ""seal the pact"" so to speak.

0,1,0,11,26,"This was semi-inspired by a post I saw yesterday, \[Spoilers PUBLISHED\] An Interesting Parallel by u/Rodrik_Stark. I enjoyed this post, but I skimmed too quickly and thought it was asking about general character comparisons. So I had all these quotes ready for Dany and Aegon and nothing to do with them!

Here's what I found:

Aegon: Wears a chain. Gifts from Illyrio. Looked over carefully. ""You look a proper prince"".

&gt;When the lad emerged from the cabin with Lemore by his side, Griff looked him over carefully from head to heel. The prince wore sword and dagger, black boots polished to a high sheen, a black cloak lined with blood-red silk. With his hair washed and cut and freshly dyed a deep, dark blue, his eyes looked blue as well. At his throat he wore three huge square-cut rubies on a chain of black iron, a gift from Magister Illyrio. Red and black. Dragon colors. That was good. ""You look a proper prince,"" he told the boy. ""Your father would be proud if he could see you.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Young Griff ran his fingers through his hair. ""I am sick of this blue dye. We should have washed it out.""

Daenerys: Wears a collar. Gifts from Illyrio. Looked over critically. ""You look all a princess"".

&gt;They dressed her in the wisps that Magister Illyrio had sent up, and then the gown, a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes. The girl slid the gilded sandals onto her feet, while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair, and slid golden bracelets crusted with amethysts around her wrists. Last of all came the collar, a heavy golden torc emblazoned with ancient Valyrian glyphs.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Now you look all a princess,"" the girl said breathlessly when they were done. Dany glanced at her image in the silvered looking glass that Illyrio had so thoughtfully provided. A princess, she thought, but she remembered what the girl had said, how Khal Drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars. She felt a sudden chill, and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms.  
&gt;  
&gt;Her brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall, seated on the edge of the pool, his hand trailing in the water. He rose when she appeared and looked her over critically. ""Stand there,"" he told her. ""Turn around. Yes. Good. You look …""

Aegon and Dany both wear collars from Illyrio, yet both are persuaded to change from Illyrio's expected course by a Westerosi confidant. Both have lost siblings, both intend to reclaim their family's kingdom, both have had humbled beginnings. Maybe there's a chance they could find some common ground.

Anyway, thanks for letting me share! I'm interested in any other character comparisons that anyone might have found curious. Jon and Jaime is another one I find interesting, for example. I also think there are more similarities between Sansa and Arya despite them feeling they are so different.

1) I want Jon's parentage to be resolved. There are two theories I really like at this moment related to Jon. One being the old age theory that he's the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna. I really want that to be true, and to know the mindset of Rhaegar, Lyanna and Elia in particular. Even if R+L=J isn't true, it would be interesting to know what the three of them thought, before and during the Rebellion. The second theory is that Rhaegar was Azor Ahai, Lyanna was Nissa Nissa and Jon is Lightbringer - the personified sword that brings the dawn after the Long Night. Though, if he did survive the upcoming conflict with the Others, I wouldn't want him to be King of Westeros. King in the North, maybe, but I'd prefer if he lived a more ""quiet"" life after everything he's been through.
On the other hand, there's the Ned and Ashara theory, with Jon inheriting Dawn - a literal lightbringer. I don't want this theory to be true, but if it is, I hope GRRM fleshes out Ashara's character and gives a satisfying explanation as to what may have happened between her and Ned.

2) It would be great if Daenerys eventually came to Westeros (before the Others invade) and mtt Aegon/Young Griff. I'd like to see her be conflicted whether to trust that he's really her nephew, or to write him off as a pretender and view him as an enemy. Personally, I hope that the theory about him being a Blackfyre (whether he himself knows it or not) were true. In any case, he and Dany meeting is a event I'd really like to see play out.

3) Some more insight into the more supernatural/mystical aspect of the universe would be nice. For example: what the Others are up to; the history of the Children of the Forest, in relation to the dynamic between them, the weirwoods and greenseers; a little peek into the workings of Asshai; the source of Melissandre's powers; what Quaithe really wants from Dany; why the seasons are so long...things like that. However, this is is one aspect of the series I don't need to be fully fleshed out (e.g. I don't need a full history of the Children, just some more information related to their ""magical"" powers).

0,1,0,25,16,"There are theories that the Great Empire of the Dawn (GEOTD) had dragons (but everyone somehow forgot, including Yi Ti and Asshai'i), which is fine, but it's also built on the theory that the Yi Tish legend of the GEOTD actually existed in the first place -- a legendary mythical empire that sounds just like Chinese myths:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Emperor
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sovereigns_and_Five_Emperors
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xia_dynasty

Emperors and dynasties that supposedly ruled for thousands of years before everyone else and which the Chinese incorporated into their ancient history for a time.

George also casted doubt on these in his own world, by the way: https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9zryq1/spoilers_extended_george_telling_us_to_take/

Somehow, when discussion comes up on the Yi Ti legend of the GEOTD, it is accepted as fact, without question... when there other civilizations claiming they're ancient as well:

&gt; In Yi Ti itself, the priests insist that mankind's first towns and cities arose along the shores of the Jade Sea and dismiss **the rival claims of Sarnor and Ghis** as the boasts of savages and children.

&gt; The World of Ice and Fire - The Bones and Beyond: Yi Ti

But for some reason we should believe the Yi Tish legend because it sounds bigger. Or because their legend attributes them to have built the Five Forts... when there is also hard evidence (bones, architecture) in the very same world book of various ancient races that predated human civilizations and also built constructions.

Theories are fine. But when you enter into a discussion about the Long Night, for example, claiming that everything can be explained for the ""fact"" of the GEOTD while refusing to accept it is a theory, you're going to have trouble with people taking you seriously, especially with the additional theory of the GEOTD having dragons.

Also, George said the Long Night was closer to 5,000 years ago, so dragonsteel is likely Valyrian steel, especially since George confirmed the Valyrians were around by then as well:

&gt; **“10,000 years” is mentioned in the novels. But you also have places where maesters say, “No, no, it wasn’t 10,000, it was 5,000.”** Again, I’m trying to reflect real-life things that a lot of high fantasy doesn’t reflect. In the Bible, it has people living for hundreds of years and then people added up how long each lived and used that to figure out when events took place. Really? I don’t think so. Now we’re getting more realistic dating now from carbon dating and archeology. But Westeros doesn’t have that. They’re still in the stage of “my grandfather told me and his grandfather told him.” So I think it’s closer to 5,000 years. But you’re right. Westeros is a very different place. There’s no King’s Landing. There’s no Iron Throne. There are no Targaryens — **Valyria has hardly begun to rise yet with its dragons and the great empire that it built.**

0,1,0,81,27,"So, the Valyrians were conquerers with dragons. They were highly mobile and roamed Essos, building outposts with the Free Cities being the most notable ones.

Yet, when the doom struck, all valyrian families and their dragons were conveniently present somewhere on that penninsula, safe for that one family where a girl had a prophetic dream and another family which had also relocated beforehand. We are also told that the Celtigars are of Valyrian descent, yet I can't find information on their looks or if they ever had dragonriders. 

So, what I don't understand is - how come, that two/ three families vacated Valyria as a whole and no other person did. On the day the doom struck, no familiy was present at, say, Lys? No one looked after their properties somewhere on Essos, not one member of another noble Valyrian family did a voyage (on a dragon), nothing. They all died. The Lyseni population is genetically Valyrian, meaning that the Valyrians frequented that place a lot, yet no one was there that day. Look at rich families today. They don't all sit in the same city or even country or continent. Rich people travel. And we know that the Targaryens loved to travel, someone was always somewhere over in Essos or even Sothoryos.

My other problem with the Valyrians, or rather the Targaryens is their Pedigree Collapse. I hate all that incest and inbreeding in asoif but we have to accept that those people suffer no ill effects from breeding with siblings for generations. Queen Alyssane and her brother had 13 children.  But when Robert came, House Targaryen was made up by one couple and their two children. No uncles, aunts or cousins left, safe for Robert and his brothers with their Targaryen grandmother. What of House Velaryon? Did they stop marrying into House Targaryen some day? 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I don't think this is especially significant, most likely it's just a plot device.

The story of Aegon The Conqueror is clearly a piece of propaganda hatched by the shrewdest political campaign strategists in the realm. Since this book is written as a proper history written in medieval times, we have to keep in mind that it was not written as a purely academic pursuit, but as an effort to advance an agenda. And this agenda is a clear pro-Aegon story meant to justify everything that he did, deter those who read it from rebelling against this new Targaryen dynasty, and 

When we read what happened we should ALWAYS keep that in mind. This story was written by the winners, and passed down through the generations, until this maester wrote it.

So who was actually this Aegon fellow? We don't know. Nobody knows. He's a mythical figure that might be very different from how he is portrayed. It's not important who he actually was, what's important is what he represents. He is nobody and everybody at the same time. If he had wanted people to know what he was really like, he would have told the maesters to write a different story about him. But he left himself, intentionally, as an enigma. You can project into his mythical image whatever you're looking for - warrior, ruler, collaborator, strong-willed, he's whatever you want him to be. That's a powerful image, and obviously deliberately crafted.

The story is meant to justify the conquest by:

1. Highlighting how bad the situation was before he came around (constant in-fighting)

2. He's not the problem - he's the solution (sure, he killed thousands but with one realm it's better for all)

3. Emphasizing that Aegon is not really a foreigner, and definitely not an outside invader (he visited Westeros, he landed in an empty space, he prays to the Seven, has banners, respects Westerosi customs and institutions, etc)

4. Making him out to be divine, with omens and godly support (the dry grass in the Field of Fire, the High Septon praying on it for seven days, etc)

I think this is the subtext that George put into his story: a man who wrote about himself as a perfect person. No one during that time would have dared write anything negative about him, and the people who did write, maesters mostly, became close allies and gained national influence through Aegon's Conquest and the unification of the realm.

On the other hand, Rhaenyra's children were mostly definitely bastards by Harwin Strong and I can see why the greens would sour to their claim. But even so, Aegon wanted nothing to do with being king, his retainers had to convince him he would die if Rhaenyra took the crown before he accepted kingship.

So who truly had the right of it during the civil war? Was it neither side? It seems clear to me that no side was truly ""correct"" they just wanted the power and would rather fight and die than give it up. I don't think I would've supported either side, the greens and the blacks were both pretty shitty imo.",1,"[Spoilers MAIN] Who were in the right, the Greens or the Blacks?",931,64

Were there predictions in those days which were widely thought to be true, but ended up being disproven? Did everyone think R+L=J would be resolved in ADWD? Did people think Dany would make it to Westeros?

It got me thinking. Have we ever seen a Dragon Egg hatch?

What if the Dragon Eggs were always stone.  What if dragons don't come from eggs? What if they come from Fire and Blood \[roll credits\]. Many Targaryens have ended up setting themselves on fire trying to 'hatch' the dragons. Maybe the secret of the source of dragons is the reason for all of this self-immolation.

The dragons may be parasites in the blood of Targaryens that require great amounts of heat or radiation to hatch.

\--------Update From Comments--------

\-In fire and Blood we see Wyrms come from the body of a burning Targeryen.  


\-We are told Wyrms come from Dragon Eggs by the Maesters.So, we know for a fact that what we were told comes from Dragon Eggs, can come from the body a burning Targeryen!  


\-Petrified eggs do not become solid stone.  


\-Valeriyens are known to sculpt seamless stone sculptures.  Like the Eggs?  


\-Dani was a burning Targeryen when she birthed her 'Children'  


\-Egg died in a fire at Summer Hall trying to birth Dragons. Also a burning Targeryen.  


\-Two separate mad kings believed burning themselves alive with wildfire was the secret to birthing dragons. No eggs are in their plans, only more burning Targeryens.  


\-The Wyrms that came from the body of Aerea's burning-Tergeryen-body died in cold water which relates to Dani bringing her Dragons into the world in a pyre hot enough to melt flesh.  


\-Dani seemed to be fireproof for a time.  Aerea was unfortunately not fireproof when Wyrms came from her body.  


\-Dani and others have given birth to 'Children' with wings and scales. This shows us dragon-like creatures inside their bodies.

I've fallen deeply in love with A Song of Ice and Fire, and you all have enhanced it, with the never ending theories and questions that I wouldn't be able to think of myself. Lately I've been thinking a lot about the Kingsmoot and how much of an emphasis was placed on the fact that the Iron Islands' haven't had a kingsmoot in a very long time prior to the one we see in A Feast For Crows.

""The Merlyn gaped at him. 'A Kingsmoot? There has not been a true kingsmoot in...' '...too long a time!' Aeron cried in anguish. 'Yet in the dawn of days the ironborn chose their own kings, raising up the worthiest amongst them. It is time we returned to the Old Way, for only that should make us great again."" The Prophet- AFFC. 

If it's been centuries since the last Kingsmoot, how was Balon Greyjoy able to declare himself king not once, but twice? And if he was able to just declare himself King, what is stopping other people from doing the same thing? Is it because there isn't a clear line of succession because Balon has two younger brothers, a daughter, and Theon's whereabouts are unknown?

0,1,0,31,0,"I think that Martin's greatest mistake with the series was including Dany from the beginning.

As we have it right now, we've had her since the beginning but she's had no relationship to the rest of the characters, especially in the first three books, which mainly concerned a Westeosi civil war.

Then starting books 4 and 5, we were introduced to a whole bunch of new faces that would become important later on, namely the Ironborn and their (likely) role as central antagonists and Aegon and his (very likely) role in a civil war against Dany, in what would be phase two of the story.

As it's currently presented, Aegon seems like a wayyyy late addition, suddenly being introduced in book 5/7(8).

But what if Dany was also introduced later? Because she won't be playing much of a role in the central story until late Winds/early Dream, what if Dany was introduced after Aegon, in Winds, having finally left Essos.

We would then get her details in flashbacks, summaries, and whatnot, similar to how we've been filled in about Aegon.

That way, they would both be on the same footing and one of them wouldn't look like they were just an extra conflict thrown in to give the other something to do.

What do you guys think?  

Edit:  /u/mithras_stoneborn had a great [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/43fl5f/spoilers_all_imagine_a_scenario_where_we_do_not/) about it.  I would have even less information, not including any of her chapters at all until Winds.

0,1,0,32,46,"I think many readers of Fire &amp; Blood were very interested in the unpleasant fate of Aerea Targaryen. What seems to get the most attention is the ambiguous creatures infesting her body, and/or whatever could have wounded Balerion. Something I haven't seen anybody mention is that, aside from parasites, Aerea's condition seems strikingly similar to what happened to Euron's man, Cragorn, when he blew the dragonhorn. They both seemed to be burning alive from the inside out. Cragorn died rather quickly, but he also put his mouth directly onto an ancient Valyrian artifact of untold power, so that might've accelerated the process, just a touch. Or, maybe Aerea's Valyrian blood gave her a slight resistance, which only served to prolong her suffering. Did she find a dragonhorn, perhaps the same one, and use it improperly? If so, could is have drawn the parasite-things to her? Or are the ruins just full of random arcane trinkets that make the user die in exciting and horrible ways?

Apologies if this has been brought up but I’ve had a thought on Bran and specifically, his death.

Let’s say Bran is warging a person in the past and his real body is killed. I assume his soul would live on in the warged person in the past.

However, what would happen if he was then given the Last Kiss by Beric (show) or Stoneheart (books)? Would he be brought back from the warged past, or would there be some other effects?

I can only see such a scenario being detrimental to his mental state in the same way that Stoneheart went off of the deep end (moralistically speaking).

Most of the analysis of the pink letter mystery examines the problem in terms of the motivations of the characters in (unknown) events prior to the letter's revelation.¹  It is perhaps mysterious only because it is examined in terms of these character motivations.  A different conclusion can be reached if we think in terms of the narrative function of what the author is communicating to the reader.

¹ I think I've heard it all on the pink letter, including the survey of the best ideas presented on this forum, summarized by the editors in Maester's Monthly Ep. 9, but, of course, nobody could have seen/heard everything said on the topic.

(A) Why is the pink wax on the letter a smudge, and not a seal?

(A1) Character-motivation analysis links this to the imagined circumstances of Mance Rayder, or some other author (not Ramsay) who lacks the seal.

(A2) If we look at the narrative function of what the author is trying to communicate to the reader, this detail is instead part of the long sequence of indications that there is a conspiracy surrounding Jon Snow: it can be taken as a direct indication that somebody else has already melted the seal, read the letter, and then re-sealed the letter, before handing it to Jon.

The point is that people are reading the smeared wax as a hint at the letter having false authorship; but this detail seems (clearly) to be disclosed to serve the narrative function of telling us why all the other people in the room (when the letter is delivered) are so nervous.  They already know the contents of the letter, and they probably have ""Plan A"" and ""Plan B"" already in mind, depending on how Jon now reacts to it.  *_These two narrative functions are mutually exclusive._*  We can't pretend that the author wanted the reader to think of both, with this single detail being mentioned (it can't be that it *both* means the author isn't Ramsay (didn't have the seal) and also that the seal was destroyed because of snooping underlings, who melted it to read Jon's private mail, etc. —it must be one or the other, in terms of the author's intent).

(B) Why is the term ""Black Crows"" used to refer to the men of the Night's Watch?

(B1) Character-motivation analysis tries to link this to the peculiar character of Mance Rayder or other characters who might be more inclined to use this slang.

(B2) The narrative function is just indicating that the author has contempt for the Night's Watch: the fact that Ramsay (or Barbrey Dustin, or Stannis, or any other plausible author) doesn't normally use the term ""Black Crows"" only reflects the fact that he/she isn't usually expressing contempt for the Night's Watch (and, indeed, most of these characters don't even have contempt for them, this is just a by-product of the fact that the letter contains a threat made in wartime).

(C) Why does the letter refer to Stannis as already defeated?

(C1) This is where character-driven interpretations branch, either seeing this disclosure as a true description of events that have already happened, or as an intentionally misleading description of events that have already happened, motivated by various characters wanting Jon Snow to march South (for various reasons).

(C2) Although the sequence of the published order of the chapters need not resemble ""real-world"" chronology, it does resemble the intention of the author: it is reasonable to interpret this disclosure in this narrative context as indicating that the letter was sent (and arrived) when no decisive ""seven day battle"" had transpired at all (i.e., at a point when neither side has been defeated, the same point the reader's POV is stuck at).

The instigating event that *has* happened (from the reader's perspective) is Theon's escape: the letter has to be viewed (by the reader) as a response to Ramsay discovering that several women conspired with Theon to escape (and they variously fought and died in assisting him).  That is a hard fact that the more creative interpretations overlook: Ramsay cannot ignore that there was a conspiracy within his castle, and while we do not know if Mance Rayder escaped (or if he is indeed in a cage) we clearly *do* know that Ramsay was alerted to all the circumstances surrounding Theon's escape by capturing at least some of ""the spearwives"".

From the reader's perspective, in terms of what the author has intentionally disclosed to us, it makes sense that we'd be expecting some sort of consequence following up after Theon's escape.  It is in Ramsay's interest to describe Stannis as defeated, but we (as readers) have also been shown repeatedly the extent to which Ramsay will engage in deception in war.

Even if you believe the seven day defeat of Stannis to be true, and you surmise that the chapters are here grossly out-of-sync with ""real events"" (so that George is providing an anticlimactic ""spoiler"" to his own story, just to provide a cliffhanger ending to the volume), how would it benefit Ramsay to send this particular truth to Winterfell?  If Ramsay's intent is to lure Jon Snow south, he could instead write a false letter pretending to be Stannis, inviting Jon to come unarmed to join him, etc.; why invite him to come with an army?

This is so implausible that many people prefer to believe the opposite: that the letter is written by Stannis as a method of inviting Jon to march south with an army (also extremely implausible).

The most implausible thing here is the narrative function of George telling you the outcome of what will happen (in a seven day battle) when he still has more than a hundred pages of story to tell.

It is not credible that George is telling the reader what will happen (as something that already has happened) when there are so many complex ""moving parts"" set out on the table, from the Manderlys to the Grey Plague, and the sacrifice of Princess Shireen.  How many pages are we talking about, minimum, for all of that to be covered, starting from the holes in the ice lake (etc. etc.)?

What *is* credible (in terms of the narrative function of what's disclosed) is that George is depicting Ramsay as someone who actually believes he'll have his conditions met, if he (thus) presents Jon Snow with these demands: Ramsay says he wants his bride back (etc.) and he's both rational enough and demented enough to imagine that the Lord Commander might comply with these demands, _if_ they're stated in the context of Stannis already having been defeated.

Conclusion: Elio Garcia is probably right, that the _Pink Letter Mystery_ was never intended to be a mystery (by the author).  The aspects of the letter that are odd (such as the wax) are supposed to alert us to the odd behavior of so many of the men surrounding Jon, who were indeed conspiring against him —and that creates many, many different cliffhangers (e.g., will the conspiracy attempt to kill Melisandre 5 minutes after Jon dies?).",1,"The Pink Letter, a different approach to plausibility (Spoilers Extended)",6898,73

But the more I watch, the more I get confused and the more questions I have. So I've come here to see if I can get some clarification. I honestly don't know how they come up with their conclusions and how so many people are convinced that they're right, but I'm willing to see what people here have to say - whether they support them or not. And I hope I don't come across like I'm bashing them. I truly want to understand them and their supporters more, and to get some more insight into their theories. 
I have loads of things I'd like to discuss but I'll address only this topic for now: 

So, I truly think that their theory about N+A=J and everything else that's associated with it is convoluted and unnecessary. I don't mind the NAJ theory - I think it's a nice alternative to R+L=J. It's just all the other theories that they attach to that, i.e. Jon had a twin, the Kingsguard are still alive, R+L=A(egon), Ashara faked her death...and all the rest of them. My concerns: 

1) Why would Ned abandon his wife and child, and marry a different woman, when he can choose an alternative path (I'll mention it below)?
2) Why would he and Ashara split up their twins, instead of leaving Jon at Starfall with his mother and sister, or letting Allyria/Val go to Winterfell with her brother and father?
3) If Dawn isn't Lightbringer and Jon the next sword of the Morning (and I don't think he will be since he isn't anywhere near among the best swordsmen in the books), what's the point of Ashara being his mother?
3) Why would Ashara fake her death and abandon her baby girl to go to Essos?
4) Who raised Allyria and Edric?
5) When and how did Allyria go beyond the wall? Why would she be made to leave a comfortable life in Dorne to go to a place where she could be attacked by white walkers at any time? I know they say Mance is Arthur Dayne, her uncle, but he couldnt totally guarantee her safety.
6) If Aegon is Ned's nephew, why would he let him grow up so far away from family? Why not unite Aegon with his aunt and uncle - Daenerys and Viserys - so Aegon wouldn't be alone? 3 Targaryens &amp; 3 dragon eggs (from Illirio)... it could have been interesting. They propose that Illyrio and Vary have a pact wirh Ned and many others, so this could have been easily arranged.
7) If RLA is true and the 3 Kingsguards survived, why wouldn't at least one of them go to Essos with Aegon to offer extra protection?
8) Why would the Winterfell Maester abandon his post and his duty to go to Essos too?
9) Did Ned intend for Aegon to come back to Westeros and conquer it, knowing that he could die in the process? I don't see him exposing his nephew to danger like that. Especially seeing what happened to all Targaryens the Lannisters and Baratheons could get their hand on.
10) In his POV, Aegon doesn't seem to doubt who he is at all. So has everyone around him really let him believe that he's Elia's son? To what end? As Rhaegar's son, he has a claim to the throne either way.
11) How can Tyrion not notice Lemore's eyes if she's really Ashara? It's not like purple eyes don't stand out. He noticed Aegons' but not hers. 

A better solution:
We know Hoster Tully was adamant that Catelyn should marry the Lord of Winterfell. And when Rickard and Brandon died, Ned had to become LoW and marry Cat in his brother's stead.
But if he was so in love with Ashara AND they were married AND they had a child (well, two) on the way, why wouldn't Ned to do the obvious thing?
He could have betrothed Cat to Benjen instead (if necessary, they could have waited a few years for the consummation like Tommen and Margaery) and renounced his claim to Winterfell, making Benjen the Lord. After the rebellion, he could have stayed to guide Benjen or lived elsewhere.
Either way, he'd stay with the love of his life; the twins would actually get to grow up together, and be raised by both parents; he wouldn't have to ""marry"" Cat under false pretences and go on to father 5 illegitimate children with her; he wouldnt have to risk someone like Roose Bolton finding out the truth and inciting another rebellion in the North; Hoster's future grandson would still end up as LoW one day, so Ned would still get Tully support in Robert's Rebellion; heck, there may even be an opportunity to pass off Rhaegar and Lyanna's baby as their own (so, as triplets with Jon &amp; Allyria), since the Daynes have Valyrian-like features anyway. The latter is more unlikely but everything else makes a lot of sense to me.
So if Ned and Ashara fell in love and got married, why wouldnt Ned just do what I mentioned above and save everyone so much grief? That'd be more in line with the character we were presented in the books, IMO.

Again, I don't mind NAJ as an alternative theory. I just havent heard compelling enough reasoning to make me like the theory. Especially when it comes to this channel. I do appreciate their content because of how much time and effort they put in. But the most off-putting thing for me isn't how far-fetched everything is. It's how they respond to people who don't agree with them that stops me from truly enjoying their content. Whenever someone disagrees with them, they usually reply with more ""evidence"" on the comment until the person is ""convinced"" or until the OP stops replying and OotGH gets the last word. Or they'll say something like ""the better question to ask is..."" and completely disregard the original question.
They seem to truly believe that their theories are exactly what GRRM intends to write in his next 2 books.
If they were more willing to admit that their theories had flaws and were open to discussing them (rather than trying to convince us that they're right, no matter what), I would enjoy their content so much more.

I have so much more I can say, but this is way too long as it is. So what do you all think about the channel and about this particular theory? Do you agree with it? Or have alternative opinions?

0,1,0,43,0,"Since finishing ASOIAF and entering the discussion of book theories there is one extremely popular theory that I just can't get my head around GRRM actually including in his story and that is R+L=J. I want to preface this by saying that I agree that the foreshadowing in the book makes this the most apparent explanation for Jon Snow's mysterious origins but here I am presenting my case that there is at least one other possibility for Jon's parentage in the books that aligns with the style of our author as well as some of the broader themes of the story. I have not read anything about the theory I am presenting here, but if you are aware of any posts sharing this theory please share.

**TLDR**

I theorize that Brandon Stark raped his sister Lyanna and impregnated her which resulted in her running away from her family with Rhaegar. In response, Brandon overreacts in a panic because of the circumstances (the possibility of the entirety of Westeros learning he raped his own sister) which is what leads him to storm into King's Landing demanding Rhaegar's head. Brandon was overcompensating to cover what he had done. Lyanna became pregnant with Brandon's son, Jon Snow, but even Ned may not have realized the nature of the situation given that Lyanna had spent an extended period of time with Rhaegar. 

**Thematic argument**

I don't have any breaking pieces of evidence to present, but the main issue I take with R+L=J is that I do not feel it fits the broader themes of the story. Religious feudal structures as we see in Westeros are built on the idea of some form of divine right based on bloodlines. Even if you argue the idea that feudalism has a practical rather than religious basis, what we see in Westeros is a dynastic system that is backed by the religious power structure, very similar to medieval feudalism. This quote from The Sworn Sword captures GRRMs criticism of religious/dynastic feudalism:

&gt;I remember once some little lord in the stormlands took Ser Arlan into service, to help him fight some other little lord. When I asked the old man what they were fighting over, he said, 'Nothing, lad. It's just some pissing contest.' 

**My issue with R+L=J**

Jon being the ""savior born of the perfect combination of bloodlines"" does not fit the themes of the story because writing Jon as the savior and king of Westeros based on a divine right enforces the validity of the feudalistic system. This revelation would undermine the most prevalent motif of the story by enforcing the moral justification of the power structure that it is criticizing.

 **Potential textual clues**

We do not learn very much of Brandon throughout the series but we have a few pieces of information about him to question his motivations. The following passage from ACOK gives us a summary of the events leading the Brandon's trial and eventual execution.

&gt;""He was on his way to Riverrun when . . ."" Strange, how telling it still made her throat grow tight, after all these years. "". . . when he heard about Lyanna, and went to King's Landing instead. It was a rash thing to do."" She remembered how her own father had raged when the news had been brought to Riverrun. The gallant fool, was what he called Brandon.
Jaime poured the last half cup of wine. ""He rode into the Red Keep with a few companions, shouting for Prince Rhaegar to come out and die. But Rhaegar wasn't there. Aerys sent his guards to arrest them all for plotting his son's murder. 

If Brandon's perception was truly that Rhaegar abducted Lyanna, why would he think it is a good idea to ride into the keep of his enemy to demand the execution of the crown prince? Given Brandon's disproportionate reaction to the discovery of Lyanna's disappearance when compared to that of his father makes me feel that there was a reason Brandon reacted so violently. 

The next bit of information is from Barbary Dustin in ADWD where we learn some information about Brandon's personality and sexually aggressive nature.

&gt;My father had great ambitions for House Ryswell. He would have served up my maidenhead to any Stark who happened by, but there was no need. Brandon was never shy about taking what he wanted. I am old now, a dried-up thing, too long a widow, but I still remember the look of my maiden's blood on his cock the night he claimed me. I think Brandon liked the sight as well. A bloody sword is a beautiful thing, yes. It hurt, but it was a sweet pain.

From this passage we learn that Brandon has no problem forcing himself on women he desires. Of course, there is no evidence that directly connects this behavior to Lyanna but sibling incest is another prevalent theme within the series. Notably, Targaryen incest, Lannister Twincest, and Euron raping his younger brothers. Based on this quote and recurring themes in our story, I believe Brandon Stark is meant to represent the ""dark side"" of House Stark. We are initially presented with House Stark as the good guys based on the strong moral character of Ned Stark and his children. What this passage from Barbary Dustin tells us is that not even the Starks were innocent of the vices and tendencies that come with nobility. 

**So who is ToJ baby???**

I see two possibilities for who was born at the ToJ that fit into this theory. I believe that it is plausible that Dany was born at the ToJ. The only living person we have to back up the claim that Dany is the daughter of the Mad King is Viserys. Viserys has a clear motive to lie about Dany's identity in that, if Dany were the daughter of Rhaegar, she would come before Viserys in the line of succession. The biggest issue with this possibility is I doubt that Willem Darry would play along with this lie. In addition, the ""Stormborn"" legend makes this possibility feel less likely. Alternatively, Aegon could be the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna. If Septa Lemoore is in fact Ashara Dayne, this would make the most sense. Ned could have brought baby Aegon to Starfall with Dawn and Ashara could have faked her death in order to care for Aegon and bring him to safety. 

**In conclusion**, I am not trying to convince anyone that this theory is truth, I am just presenting a possibility that, in some ways, aligns to the themes of the story and patterns of our author. B+L=J captures all of the recurring symbolism relating Jon and Lyanna and also makes Jon fall into the ""cripples, bastards, and broken things"" archetype that GRRM constantly goes back to throughout his works. In my opinion, this explanation also makes the most sense as a possibility given the show director's choice to reveal R+L=J. I believe the show may have combined the characters of Jon and Aegon and decided the go with this option rather than having a primary protagonist in a high budget production who is revealed to be the product of incest rape. This allows the show to take its own path and still present the very compelling twist of Jon being the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna without actually spoiling what is to come in the books.

&amp;#x200B;

«  **She could still remember how it felt.** » (Sansa, AFFC)

It’s  the feeling more than the man or the moment where it  happened that  marked her. Would it be possible that someone else had  kissed her? That  somebody else gaved her this first kiss?

&amp;#x200B;

If  another man had kissed her but it was disturbing as first kiss, she had  could, with time, merge this kiss with the Hound who asked for a song.  And she thought he was going to kiss her. The merge would be necessary  if her first kiss was worse than if it had  been given by the Hound.

&amp;#x200B;

The author said Sansa is an “unreliable  narrator”. What could this mean? What could be the purpose of this?

&amp;#x200B;

It is interesting to note that whenever Sansa thinks of the unkiss of the Hound, she is in contact with a child.

She  talks about child games (kissing games) with Tyrell’s girls and this is  the first time she thinks about the unkiss and wonders what her  companions would think.

« She \[Megga\] and  Alla played a kissing game sometimes, she confessed, but it wasn’t the  same as kissing a man, much less a king. **Sansa wondered what Megga would think about kissing the Hound, as she had.** » (Sansa, ASOS)

&amp;#x200B;

Robin, her cousin, kisses her and it is this childish kiss that reminds her of what she felt during her first kiss.

« **As the boy’s lips touched her own she found herself thinking of another kiss.** **She could still remember how it felt.** » (Sansa, AFFC)

&amp;#x200B;

It’s  not seems a pleasant memory but she uses it as a way out and thinks  about it less negatively than all the nightmares she does. She seems to be attached to this memory, to this sensation.

« **She thought** of Tyrion, and **of the Hound and how he’d kissed her.** » (Sansa, AFFC)

&amp;#x200B;

Sansa  never thinks about it when she’s with Tyrion or when Littlefinger  kisses her. It is the presence of children and family that make her  think of this kiss. It would be  possible, therefore, that if this  kiss is recalled to her by children,  it is because a child had kissed  her during a game perhaps.

I  had the  crazy idea that Jon kissed Sansa when they were kids. He saw  himself as  Prince Aemon and she as Queen Naerys. They could have played  and their game could have ended in a kiss that would have disturbed  both of them.

« **She called for the heroes** from the songs, for Florian and **Ser Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight**, but no one heard. » (Sansa, ACOK)

« They were not little boys when they fought, but knights and mighty heroes. “**I’m Prince Aemon the Dragonknight,” Jon would call out**, and Robb would shout back, “Well, I’m Florian the Fool.” Or Robb would say, “I’m the Young Dragon,” and **Jon would reply, “I’m Ser Ryam Redwyne.** » (Jon, ASOS)

&amp;#x200B;

Sansa  could have rejected this memory because too painful to assume (the  books show us that she forgets and modifies some memories). This would  also explain why Jon becomes sullen, flees the love songs (songs that   Sansa liked to sing), gets drunk at the feast, is frustrated to see   Sansa « **looks radiant** » at Joffrey’s arm and longs desperately to join the Night Watch.

&amp;#x200B;

If the goal is to denounce incest and to show a parallel and a difference  with Jaimie and Cersei, it would be interesting. Jon &amp; Sansa could  have gotten lost in their game as kids but, each in their own way would  have try to fight this until their reunion and revelation of Jon’s  identity.

&amp;#x200B;

I can not help but find weird  that, not only Sansa, but Jon also thinks very little about his sister.  He meets a young girl who has red hair, eyes the same color of his  sister and loves to sing, yet he speaks only of  the resemblance between  the personality of Ygritte and that of Arya. He thinks of Arya  &amp; Bran playing with snow but no mention of Sansa while, a few  chapters before, Sansa remembered the snowball battles she was doing  with Arya &amp; Bran. It’s as if each of them forced themselves not to  think of the other.

For her part, Sansa  seems to  have used Jon as a reference to create her bastard identity:  same age  as Jon there last time she saw him (14 years old), doesn’t  like to dance and so on. But she does not seem to have consciously  realized this fact, she does not think of Jon. It's only when Myranda tells her that he has become Lord Commander that she remembers him.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, we can notice that when the snow falls on Sansa's face the girl likens snow to a lover. And it reminds her home, childhood and dreams. It’s curious to equate romantic love to the home, snow to the lover...

« **She had last seen snow the day she’d left Winterfell.** That was a lighter fall than this, she remembered. »

« Drifting **snowflakes brushed her face** as light **as lover’s kisses**, and melted on her cheeks. »

« **She  could feel the snow on her lashes, taste it on her lips. It was the  taste of Winterfell. The taste of innocence. The taste of dreams.** » (Sansa, AFOC)

The  snowflakes could  have reminded her of her mother’s arms and thus bring  her back to childhood. But no, it’s  something else. It’s not the snow on her face that reminds her of her home and her memories but the taste on her lips. Curious choice. And just after this memory, Sansa is on her knees and doesn’t remember how she fell. I think there is something to see behind that.

« When Sansa opened her eyes again, **she was on her knees. She did not remember falling.** » (Sansa, AFOC)

&amp;#x200B;

I will add that Sansa has kept the Hound’s cloack, feels safe when she wears it and refers to it as the Targaryen emblem.

« **He took a song and a kiss, and left me nothing but a bloody cloak.** »  (Sansa, AFFC)

« When she crawled out of bed, long moments later, she was alone. **She found his cloak** on the floor, twisted up tight, **the white wool stained with blood and fire.** » (Sansa, ACOK)

&amp;#x200B;

However, Jaime Lannister makes an important connection between the Hound’s cloack and Jon.

« **What was the name of that bastard** he fathered? \[…\]**Snow,** that was the one. **Such a white name**… **like the pretty cloaks they give us in the Kingsguard** when we swear our pretty oaths. » (Jaime, ACOK)

&amp;#x200B;

 

To finish, as someone reminded me, Catelyn Stark used to play at kissing game with Littlefinger even though she had always saw  him as a brother. I think it’s not trivial if kissing games are mentioned several times (Margaery &amp; her cousins, Cat &amp; Littlefinger...).   
Just like the fact that Littlefinger has convinced himself that he had sex with Catelyn while it was Lysa.   


Littlefinger  therefore substituted in his mind the person with whom he had a romantic act. This could be a clue to indicate that Sansa did the same thing, but not for the same reasons of course.

&amp;#x200B;

Tell me what you think. Of course it is only an idea that came to me. I'm not saying that's it, I just wondering.

I would like to add that this is not a post to say that Jonsa is endgame. Jonerys can be, or whatever. I just think of all the possibilities. And as the author had originally planned a romance between Arya and Jon, I tell myself that if he had kept this idea, there would have been clues. So maybe if Jonsa is endgame there are. Otherwise it doesn't matter. I'm just trying to understand Sansa's chapters.",1,[Spoilers EXTENDED] Sansa &amp; The Hound. What did GRR Martin mean? Jonsa crazy theory.,7613,88

George appears to be avoiding reference to Howland in the present tense. It is especially strange that he answers 'ditto' to the second question when one is concerning a living character and one a (presumably) dead character.

George appears to have a policy against lying to his fans, so he may have said '**he'd be in his thirties**' instead of saying '**He's in his thirties**' because Howland is in fact dead. It's certainly strange that he didn't appear on Robb's side during the War of Five Kings.

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER, George has stated that Howland will appear in the books. Maybe he said '**He'd be**' because he hadn't actively considered Howland's age yet, just as someone might said a friend from the past 'would be' a certain age.

In TWOIAF, we have speculations by some maesters that the Seastone chair was created by the visitors from the Sunset Sea.

&gt;  Maester Kirth in his collection of ironborn legends, Songs the Drowned Men Sing, has suggested that the chair was left by visitors from across the Sunset Sea, but there is no evidence for this, only speculation.

&gt; Archmaester Haereg once advanced the interesting notion that the ancestors of the ironborn came from some unknown land west of the Sunset Sea, citing the legend of the Seastone Chair. The throne of the Greyjoys, carved into the shape of a kraken from an oily black stone, was said to have been found by the First Men when they first came to Old Wyk. Haereg argued that the chair was a product of the first inhabitants of the islands, and only the later histories of maesters and septons alike began to claim that they were in fact descended of the First Men. 

If the Seastone chair was left by visitors from the Sunset Sea, and it is not impossible to sail from Westeros to Asshai over the Sunset Sea, the possibility is that the IronBorn, being hardy shipfarers, originated from Yi-Ti, and from the Bloodstone Emperor, who is associated with holy black stones.

Hello everyone. Wanted to gather anyone's &amp; everyone's thoughts about something. Doing a reread and this passage stood out to me. It's from chapter 9 of ASOS Bran's first chapter. Some context, Bran is in Summer and comes upon a deer. The passage:

   'The deer was down and dying when he reached her, ringed by eight of his small grey cousins. The heads of the pack had begun to feed, the male first and then his female, taking turns tearing flesh from the red underbelly of their prey. The others waited patiently, all but the tail, who placed in a wary circle a few strides from the rest, his own tail tucked low. He would eat last of all, whatever his brother left him.'

   Does anyone think this is possibly foreshadowing something? If so, what? Animals were used in the first chapter of AGOT foreshadowing by using a dire wolf killed by a stag leaving the remaining pups. Does anyone think this is foreshadowing of something? 

   I put some thought into it but didn't come up with anything. I may just be overthinking but that's what we do in the fandom. Some interesting things- it mentions wolves and not dire wolves. Regular wolves often symbolize northmen. It makes a comment about the head of the pack (male and female) eating first. (Not counting heads, that leaves 6 remaining wolves). The 6 wait patiently before they eat. One, the tail, paces back and forth and only will eat what is remaining.

   Seems to specific to me to not be foreshadowing. Could this hint at the red wedding? (Male and female being Rob and Catelyn, 6 being the other lords, with the tail possibly representing Tully or even Roose?) 

   Personally, I don't think it represents the red wedding but possibly something else. Since it talks about wolves and not dire wolves, I don't think it involves the Starks. Idk.  GNC? Something else? Thoughts? 

  Edit: there is actually more to the passage as well. Short version, as I'm on mobile, is Summer jumps down, 3 break away, one fights but summer gets him, the lead male turns around and is described with a white muzzle signifying his old age and is bloody from just eating.

0,1,0,12,7," It  struck me that not many castles in Westeros are named -fort. In fact  there are only five, and all of them are associated with some dark  stuff, most dating back to the First Men:

* The  Nightfort: easily the most sinister one, having been the residence of  the Night's King (possibly a Bolton), then the place of the stories  about the Rat Cook, the 79 sentinels and Danny Flint. It's also  described as a labyrinthine fortress. The fort contains a weirwood door  in the Wall which glows and requires a Night's Watch brother to recite  his vows to open it.
* The Dreadfort: The seat of House Bolton. Nuff said.
* The  Redfort: Not really sinister, but given the fact that Domeric Bolton,  descendent of the Red Kings, was fostered there, a possible link is only  strengthened when you consider the fort's name. It's also had a  traditional alliance with House Royce, and somehow two out of seven  (counting Ramsay) male members of House Bolton were named Royce.
* The  Dun Fort: Dun may just be a word for a fortress, but the fort was the  seat of House Darklyn, overlooking the city of Duskendale whose walls  glow palely in pre-dawn. Aerys was kept prisoner at the Dun Fort before  his madness got unlocked.
* The  Banefort: It used to be the seat of the Hooded King Morgon Banefort,  who was a necromancer. He was fed to king Loreon Lannister's lions which  broke free a few years later and killed three of Loreon's sons.

On  the other end of the world you have the Five Forts. They are built from  the same black, light-drinking stone as other ancient constructs around  the world, including labyrinthine structures such as the Hightower in  Oldtown. Structures made of black stone are possibly linked to some  precursor species, likely nautical, maybe the Drowned God, the Shadow,  etc.

0,1,0,47,129,"&gt;*The sand Snakes, men called his daughters. So far as Tyrion had heard, Prince Oberyn had never fathered a son*

*ASOS Tyrion V*

But how come?

It’s seems a bit unrealistic that he bedded many women and ended up only with daughters and never a son.

(I did a little research but I couldn’t find anything that suggests 100% that a man can have only sons or only daughters scientifically speaking, so I started to look at this more in terms of the narrative.)

So what could be the narrative value of Oberyn fathering only daughters?

I do believe that there is actually a reason for this, for why the sand Snakes are only female with no brothers.

First, let’s take a look at a certain incident regarding the eldest Sand Snake, Obara Sand.

&gt;*The day my father came to claim me, my mother did not wish for me to go. ‘****She is a girl,****' she said, ‘and I do not think that she is yours. I had a thousand other men.' He tossed his spear at my feet and gave my mother the back of his hand across the face, so she began to weep. ‘Girl or boy, we fight our battles,' he said, ‘but the gods let us choose our weapons.'* ***He pointed to the spear, then to my mother's tears, and I picked up the spear.***

Now we’re not told precisely when this took place, but I have a strong feeling it took place around the year 383 AC, sometime after Roberts rebellion, which would make Obara around 11-12 years old. We’re also not told why Oberyn did this, and it seemed almost too cruel on Oberyn’s part, as we don’t know him to be abusive towards women or whores or anyone (except Lannisters I guess).

Though I won’t justify him, I would like to propose/theories what the drive could have been for him to do this, and the answer, I believe, lies with Elia Martell.

We don’t know much about Elia, but we do know that she was somewhat delicate of health due to her being born a month premature. I think we could logically conclude that these same health issues could have prevented Elia from training for battle. It’s possible that a part of Oberyn believes, that had Elia been trained, or somehow capable of protecting herself, she could have killed ser Gregor and survived the incident with her children.

This brings me to the Sand snakes. It’s not that Oberyn never had sons, only he’s first and only priority was to make sure his daughters don’t face the same end as Elia.

He wasn’t there to keep Elia safe. Elia wasn’t trained to keep herself safe, but Oberyns daughters will be.

""***He pointed to the spear, then to my mother's tears, and I picked up the spear.****”*

So when Oberyn asks Obara to choose between tears: a more common weapon amongst women, the weapon Elia was left with. And a spear: a weapon made for killing and defending yourself, he’s making sure what happened to Elia doesn’t end up happening again to his daughter.

So where could this go from here?

It’s possible that with the sand Snakes being on their way to KL, and a certain Robert strong (who could be Gregor) being there, that one of them at least ends up facing a similar circumstance to Elia, and I guess we'll see if Oberyn’s parenting technique worked or not.

0,1,0,14,0,"Something I've always wondered about is why didn't Rhaegar get Eila back to Dragonstone when he returned to the Red Keep from the TOJ but before he headed to the Trident? In the worst case scenario, Dragonstone wouldn't be the rebels' first target like the Red Keep (which is likely why Aerys sends Rhaella) and the gold cloaks aren't known to be particularly reliable. Rhaegar also leaves three KG with Lyanna, takes three with him to the Trident, and leaves only 17 year old Jaime to protect Aerys, Elia, Rhaenys, and Aegon. Again, that's questionable at best.



My dark tin foil theory is that while Rhaegar initially planned a polygamous marriage or to attempt to annul his marriage to Elia (despite having no grounds) while keeping Aegon as heir, he later intended to try and set Elia and his kids with her aside and that's why he didn't get her out back to Dragonstone or Dorne when he returned from the TOJ—because he knew Elia would be a valuable hostage (again) once Dorne learned Rhaegar was ditching her and the kids for Lyanna. Rhaegar, like Renly and Loras's plan to try and get Robert to set Cersei aside for Marg, isn't that politically savvy and wouldn't realize that it would create a huge shit storm. Perhaps he intended to argue that Elia only provided him with one male heir, but plenty of other high born ladies did the same (including his own mother for sixteen years until Viserys was born) and he had a male spare in his own brother. GRMM repeats the Ice and Fire bit, so I suspect it'll be revealed that Rhaegar became convinced that not only did the PTWP have to fit all of the prophecy, but that he must also come from the union of ice and fire and if he wanted to recreate the three original conquerors—well, they all had the same mother.




If Rhaegar left Elia on Dragonstone, it would be easier for Dorne to smuggle her out and steal her away back to Dorne and declare independence for the insult paid to them. But if she is in the Red Keep, she and the kids can continue to be hostages for Dorne's good behavior.

0,1,0,15,20,"Overall, I love Fire &amp; Blood.  As a real world history nerd, I got giddy every time ""Gyldane"" digressed over conflicting sources, so this book was something that very much appealed to my tastes.  


There are two points though I found frustrating in their absence from the text.  


The discussion of the death of Viscerys I makes reference to him telling the tale of the Old King flying Vermithor against a Wildling host (including the likes of giants and wargs).  Such a battle was never mentioned in the chapters dedicated to the reign of Jahaerys I, and while I understand that not every event of his reign is covered, that seems an significant of enough event to warrant substantive discussion.  And if no such event ever occurred, THAT seems to warrant a comment from Gyldane when he tells of Viscerys I entertaining his descendants with the tale.  


It would be a MAJOR event because in large part it would provide something almost otherwise absent: the use of dragon-power before the lords of Westeros in defense of the Realm from an outside threat.  The closest event that might meet that standard is Jahaerys involvement in Rogar's War (against a Vulture King of the Red Mountains of Dorne).  But few would have witnessed such an, and the enemies involved would be smaller and more asymmetric.  


It strikes me that Jahaerys taking Vermithor North to fight an invading Wildling host would have done a great deal in the aftermath of a) stripping lands from the northern most lords of the North for the Second Gift, and b) stripping lords of the right of First Night, a practice mostly found in the North, to both earn the respect of lords upset over these measures, aswell as impress upon them the threat of dragon-power, something the lords of the North unlike their southern counterparts had never directly witnessed.  


  
The other point is with regard to the legal claim of Aegon III's legitimacy.  It isn't discussed in Fire &amp; Blood (though if memory serves it is mentioned in the abridged version of the text in Princess and the Queen - where it was a spiteful decree from Aegon II, but there should be more info than that to explain why Cragen Stark and Aegon III let said decree stand) but it stands to reason that Queen Rhaenyra is not counted among the reigning Targaryen monarchs of Westeros in large part because Aegon II took the throne before her, and was still alive through her entire ""reign"".  Fair enough.  But it should warrant discussion that Aegon III's legitimate claim to the throne would be established not through his mother, but through his father, as the paternal uncle to Aegon II.  This would reinforce the Green position that the crown can only pass not only to exclusively male heirs, but also only through the male line.  Text following the dance certainly seems to act like this was established, but Rhaenyra's son on the throne would seem to counter that, unless his claim was based on his father.  This would make sense as a Green/Black compromise: Rhaenyra's line inherits the throne, but their legitimacy is established through Daemon as the heirs to Aegon II, holding to the Green position of patrilineal primogeniture.",1,[Spoilers Extended] 2 points I felt missing from Fire &amp; Blood,3178,65

&gt;""The horse,"" he answered at once. Again like his father; Ned would always take the more dangerous task himself.
&gt;""And the other?""
&gt;The Greatjon is always saying that we should smash Lord Tywin. I thought I'd give him the honor.""
&gt;It was his first misstep, but how to make him see it without wounding his fledgling confidence? ""Your father once told me that the Greatjon was as fearless as any man he had ever known.""
&gt;Robb grinned. ""Grey Wind ate two of his fingers, and he laughed about it. &gt;So you agree, then?""
&gt;""Your father is not fearless,"" Catelyn pointed out. ""He is brave, but that is very different.""
&gt;Her son considered that for a moment. ""**The eastern host will be all that stands between Lord Tywin and Winterfell**,"" he said thoughtfully. ""**Well, them and whatever few bowmen I leave here at the Moat. So I don't want someone fearless, do I**?""
&gt;""No. You want cold cunning, I should think, not courage.""
&gt;""Roose Bolton,"" Robb said at once. ""That man scares me.""

I thought this passage was strange. Catelyn is a decent advisor to Robb, but she lets this point slide because she doesn't want Robb to choose the Greatjon as a commander, and it has consequences later on. 

While the eastern host is important to lure Tywin into battle, it isn't needed to block the path to Winterfell. A small Lannister force would be stopped by the crannogmen and Moat Cailin, and sending a large force would weaken Tywin in the main theater of the war so he'd never do it. Robb's infantry could be wiped out and Tywin still wouldn't attack the North.

This mistake on Robb's part is important because he then chooses Roose Bolton as a commander. Bolton was a good choice. He had the largest force of infantry, and as a cautious man he'd be expected to succeed in the diversion without having the entire force wiped out (although Robb basically ignored the infantry host for the rest of the war. Why was Roose never stripped of command after his debacle at the Green Fork? Why didn't Edmure order him to march on King's Landing as soon as Tywin marched west?). Little did they know he'd intentionally get almost half the force killed in the battle, and continue to do so throughout the war.

I just think it's funny. If Catelyn had let Robb choose the Greatjon he very well could have succeeded in smashing Tywin due to Addam Marbrand's terrible scouting. And if his force was wiped out it would have weakened Robb's position in the Riverlands (perhaps without the Greatjon there Robb isn't named king, either), but it wouldn't have threatened the North until the infantry were needed to liberate Moat Cailin.",1,(Spoilers Extended) Why Does Catelyn Let Robb Get Away With Saying This?,2803,72

0,1,0,9,0,"So I just recently found out about Dorne actually pissed of about what Rhaegar did that's why they only gave 10,000 men in RR. And it seems like people already concluded that Elia did not agree with Rhaegar and Lyanna due to this.

My theory is that they were pissed when Rhaegar humiliated Elia in front of the great lords in the Tourney of Harrenhal by crowning Lyanna as the queen of love and beauty, not because he had another woman. I think Elia was pissed, too that is probably why the Dorne felt the same. I think she said ""hey I don't care if you're gonna have another woman but do you really have to humiliate me in front of everyone"" (i think that's what she said because of how their marriage was actually loveless) But I honestly don't think this indicates what Elia feels about Rhaegar and Lyanna. If Rhaegar did not do that probably Dorne would be like ""ah yeah well we do that here too"", but the humiliating was like ""hey we don't do that here and f you for humiliating our princess"". Dorne is still known for being open minded about this stuff, but they're not known for being open minded about humiliation especially to their beloved princess.

or

Dorne probably did got pissed when they found out that Rhaegar runaway with another woman. But I still don't think this equates to what Elia felt. Elia probably agreed for Rhaegar to take another woman, but the Dorne didn't knew about that as that was probably just a conversation between Elia and Rhaegar. And by the time they could have asked the princess if she agreed to it, she was already held hostage by the mad king. I mean i believe that if you are taken as hostage you really can't personally send any words to other people already. And because of how they knew that Elia was pissed when Rhaegar humiliated her in the tourney, they probably concluded that Elia did not agree for Rhaegar to go with another woman. Or they didn't really need Elia's feelings about it? They were just pissed with or without knowledge of how Elia felt towards with it, too? I mean we all know that Rhaegar did not saw a rebellion coming, so his (or their) plan was probably to keep him having another woman as secret at first, find a right time then declare he took another wife and they have a child. but that doesn't mean Elia won't be queen she will still be and his children with her will still be the heir as Aegon was still the first born son and not his son with Lyanna (I still think that's what happened. GRRM never ruled out the possibility of polygamy, or they can even marry under the old gods. and the TOJ scene, you can say Arthur and Oswell are there to follow their prince who are really close to them, i'll believe you. but the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard Ser Gerold Hightower is certainly not there to follow the prince. and they keep saying they are there for their vows, not because their prince wanted them there unlike in the show. also, i still don't think Rhaegar bastardized his other children. he was looking for the third head of the dragon not an heir that has a Stark blood). and I think if that planned happened the Dorne might not got pissed. because it was secured that there will be no changes in terms of Elia and her children. they mostly probably don't know about that plan (because it was probably between Elia and Rhaegar again) and they probably thought that Rhaegar choosing another woman means Elia and her children will be set aside and be humiliated for it, that's why they got pissed. Because again, Dorne is pretty open minded about bastard and having another woman but they are not open minded about their beloved princess being humiliated.

0,1,0,9,7,"First of all, let me just say that I do not have the ""power of theory."" That is, there are so many people on these types of subs that seem to be able to break every single book down to their very basic parts and create extravagant theories from them. I seem to get lost when I try to do such things, but when reading the books, watching the shows, or listening to theories, sometimes a quick little switch in my brain flicks and I have a thought that makes sense, but trying to prove it by finding a shred of evidence is beyond me. Anyway, if the following theories seem way off base or too circumstantial, that may be why. If you feel like expanding, feel free! I mainly just want to start a conversation with like-minded individuals because I love discussing ASOIAF!

&amp;#x200B;

My first thought is about the [Azor Ahai](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai) prophecy. I was thinking about the line ""... *Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone*..."" (Melisandre to Jon Snow) and it made me think about the ""smoke and salt"" bit. This may be a bit of a stretch, but I'd like to break this down real quick: fires smoke after being put out (fire also smokes while burning, but that's beside the point), and water, particularly sea water, is salty. Water puts fires out, and fires tend to smoke after being extinguished.

Now, hold on before you think ""what is this loony writing."" While I did say that I was not really great at gathering tonnes of evidence, I do know that Euron Greyjoy, the ~~Shithead~~ Crow's Eye, is planning on doing... [something](http://poorquentyn.tumblr.com/post/145196043123/hi-ive-seen-you-mentioned-an-eldritch-apocalypse). He's obsessed with the sea, arguably more so than his brother, Aeron Damphair, since Aeron would probably never consider doing [something](https://www.player.one/game-thrones-season-7-spoilers-dont-underestimate-euron-crows-eye-548079) as atrocious as Euron ([raising a kraken](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/4v7wg3/spoilers_everything_will_euron_summon_a_kracken/)? Becoming a kraken? Drowning all of Westeros? Making the citizens of Westeros into fish people?) Anyway, I see him as the embodiment of the sea, which is salt water. I've seen the theory that [Patchface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZQOje3DdMk&amp;list=PLn6yDpEottdhisSEKJE3Sv5fpYQuej0Ju&amp;index=4) is actually the embodiment of the sea, but for this theory, I'm choosing to focus on Euron since he was actively seeking Dany out last we saw him.

Who's the embodiment of fire? Well, Dany, obviously. She is the last [full Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daenerys_Targaryen). Jon is a Targ, too, but he's half-and-half Stark/Targ. A [Starg](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Lyanna_Stark). Young Griff is [probably](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_Targaryen_(son_of_Rhaegar)) a Targaryen, but is also [probably](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6cl3m6/spoilers_extended_young_griff_house_blackfyre_and/) a Blackfyre, so the only documented, real, *true* Targaryen is Daenerys. She embodies fire.

Okay, so, let's think about the idea of ""smoke and salt."" Fires do tend to smoke when put out, and what can put fires out? Water. Sea water. What if Euron kills Dany? What if that's part of the prophecy somehow?

This is where my idea kind of falls apart: what about ""stone dragons""? Well, according to ASX's video about Patchface, his ultimate destiny may be to bring Greyscale to Westeros through Shireen, who may actually still have the Greyscale dormant within her. Classically, dragons have been referred to as menaces, but so have plagues. In the ASOIAF world, they kind of are, too. Drogon has eaten way too many sheep (and possibly children) when Dany was in Meereen, and there are references throughout the books that the bigger a dragon gets, the more it needs to eat. Balerion the Black Dread was... fucking massive. Imagine feeding that monster. If dragons get that big, wouldn't they, to the small folk, seem like menaces? So, maybe ""\[waking\] dragons out of stone"" doesn't mean dragons as we know them, but Greyscale, since dragons *and* Greyscale have, well, scales. That's all in ASX's video, btw, I'm just kind of trying to make the connection in my mind.

So, perhaps Euron kills Dany and Greyscale is awoken somehow? Maybe it's Patchface that kills Dany. He is seen as evil and/or untrustworthy by some characters. Shireen is *directly* connected to Patchface, and he *is* from the sea. But anyway, I feel like Euron will kill Dany. [This](https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/950675/Game-of-Thrones-season-8-spoilers-Daenerys-Targaryen-devastating-loss-Euron-Greyjoy-twist) [isn't](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/game-thrones-theory-euron-killing-230802560.html) [a](https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Euron-Kill-Daenerys-Game-Thrones-43772153) [new](https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/6vaju3/euron_is_going_to_kill_dany/) [theory](https://www.quora.com/Will-Euron-Greyjoy-be-the-downfall-of-Daenerys-Targaryen), but I feel like it may connect to the prophecy of ""smoke and salt.""

&amp;#x200B;

My second (and far more explainable) idea is of [Lightbringer](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer) (the old sword from the tale, not the one we're waiting for in ASOIAF) and [Valyrian steel](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Valyrian_steel). We know that the [Valyrians](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Valyria) were [kind of assholes](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Slavery), despite being a very advanced society. They produced the [Faceless Men](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faceless_Men) (also kind of assholes in their own regard, essentially buying and selling death; fruit didn't fall from the tree?), and the very land the Valyrians inhabited [wiped them](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria) [from the planet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-T6ICuywY&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLn6yDpEottdhisSEKJE3Sv5fpYQuej0Ju). Before that, though, they used magic and dragons and slaves. They were proficient at using all three.

Lightbringer is a magical sword, and is romanticised through the tale of its forging, but we know that Valyrian steel has magical properties. The obvious conclusion on how Valyrian steel was made was with dragon fire and magic. Or maybe just dragon fire since dragons are, you know, magical. But what if Lightbringer *was* Valyrian steel? What if that was how Valyrian steel was made? Again, this isn't [a](https://aminoapps.com/c/thrones/page/blog/is-lightbringer-the-first-valyrian-steel-sword/KWGI_MuRlzYLa6d5EVZJEKrM4vxa60g) [new](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/66hl7l/everything_is_lightbringer_valyrian_steel/) [theory](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/144781-is-lightbringer-the-first-valyrian-steel/). Dragon fire would imbue the steel with its own unique magic properties, and we know of three things that can kill The Others/White Walkers: Valyrian steel, obsidian/Dragonglass, and, the most common denominator of them all, dragon fire. But what if something *more* makes Valyrian steel so special? What if there has to be human sacrifice and a sort of Warg-like property to make it actual Valyrian steel? Nissa Nissa was killed to make Lightbringer, and ""her soul combin\[ed\] with the steel of the sword.""

We're told that the process of Valyrian steel was lost in the Doom, but maybe the legend of Azor Ahai/Lightbringer/Nissa Nissa was the first written account of the process of Valyrian steel, and so it's not *completely* lost.

Maybe the legendary Lightbringer, which is seen as the sword of the Good Guys, and Valyrian steel, which every great house seems to have, is actually imbued with a dark secret and past, and maybe each contains a **soul**. That may be a little tinfoil-esque, but it would explain the insane strength of the steel, the magical properties, and the almost otherworldliness of it. We know Valyrian steel can be reforged, but it cannot be made. Maybe that's because it needs two things: dragon fire and sacrifice. The Valyrians had lots of both: dragons and slaves.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: So, in essence, my first (and rather crumbly) thought is that perhaps Euron will kill Dany (and this will somehow spread a plague across the face of Westeros), and my second thought is that maybe the original Lightbringer *is* Valyrian steel/Valyrian steel *is* the original Lightbringer, and human sacrifice/souls are needed along with dragon fire to make it.",1,"(Spoilers Extended) Smoke and Salt, and Valyrian Steel",8561,54

&gt; Amongst the Lyseni, it is truly said, **wars are fought with plots and poisons
rather than with armies.** For the rest of that bloody year, the magisters and
merchant princes of Lys performed a deadly dance, rising and falling almost
fortnightly. Oft as not their falls were fatal. Torreo Haen was poisoned with
his wife, his mistress, his daughters (one being the maid whose wisp of a
gown had caused such scandal at the Maiden’s Day Ball), siblings, and
supporters at the feast he held to celebrate his elevation to first magister.
Silvario Pendaerys was stabbed through the eye leaving the Temple of Trade,
whilst his brother Pereno was garroted in a pillow house as a slave girl pleasured him with her mouth. The gonfaloniere Moreo Dagareon was slain
by his own elite guards, and Matteno Orthys, a fervent worshipper of the
goddess Pantera, was mauled and partly devoured by his prized shadowcat
when its cage was unaccountably left open one night.

Dany will likely install one or more of her candidates to rule over Lys. But will they be able to keep peace for long? Here are the 2 major instances where we see peace being broken in Lys by the murder of the ruler:

First we have the murder of Lysandro Rogare orchestrated by the Faceless Men. 

&gt; Lysandro drowned when his opulent barge sank whilst carrying him
from his Perfumed Garden back to his palace. Though a few would insist that
their deaths were unfortunate accidents, many more took the manner and
timing of their passings as proof of a plot to bring down House Rogare. The
**Faceless Men of Braavos were widely believed to have been responsible for
the killings; no more subtle assassins were known to exist anywhere in the
wide world.**
But if indeed the Faceless Men had done these deeds, at whose bidding had
they acted? The Iron Bank of Braavos was suspected, as was the Archon of
Tyrosh, Racallio Ryndoon, and various merchant princes and magisters of
Lys known to have chafed under the “velvet tyranny” of Lysandro the
Magnificent.

Second, we have the murder of Sharako Lohar who had fought in the Dance alongside the Greens, presumably over the affections of courtesan-cum-virtual ruler Black Swan.

&gt;The murder of Sharako Lohar of Lys, the admiral who had presided
over the Triarchy’s disaster in the Gullet, proved to be the spark that engulfed
the Three Daughters in flames, fanning the smoldering rivalries of Tyrosh,
Lys, and Myr into open war. It is now commonly accepted that Sharako’s
death was a personal matter; the arrogant admiral was slain by one of his
rivals for the favor of a **courtesan known as the Black Swan.**


And after both these deaths, Lys underwent a series of regime changes. The series of murders after Rogare's death is already quoted earlier. And here we have the consequence of Lohar death. 

&gt; In Lys, ancient houses fell and many a highborn magister
was cast down and ruined, whilst others rose up to seize the reins of power.
Chief amongst these was Lysandro Rogare and his brother Drazenko,
architect of the Dornish alliance. Drazenko’s ties to Sunspear and Lysandro’s
to the Iron Throne made the Rogares the princes of Lys in all but name.

Anyways, we do have a certain character who ties all these motifs together. Someone who is in the apprenticeship of Faceless Men who are experts in the art of subtle assassination. Someone who is learning the art of poisoning. Someone who we are also specifically told is learning Lyseni. 

&gt; He was insisting that she improve her High Valyrian and learn the tongues of Lys and Pentos too.

Someone who is likely going to be sent to train as a courtesan in her upcoming arc. Someone whose arc has already brought her in contact with a courtesan known as Black Pearl. And most importantly someone whose arc is filled with the swan imagery and the only character in whose POV we see 3 black swans. 

&gt; Thirty yards from shore, three black swans were gliding over the water, so serene . . . no one had told them that war had come, and they cared nothing for burning towns and butchered men. She stared at them with yearning. Part of her wanted to be a swan. 

##Motive

If by this time Dany has united most of the Free Cities, Dothraki Sea and Slaver's Bay under her, will the Braavosi see a flashback of the Valyrian Empire they escaped and brought down? Irrespective of the stance of this new dragonlord towards slavery. Or will it be because Iron Bank has already invested in Stannis and it protects their investment if Dany stays embroiled in Essos? Will it be because Dany herself will borrow from some bank other than the Iron Bank for her conquest and if she wins, the hold of Iron Bank over the Iron Throne may weaken considerably? As it happened in the case of Rogares. Or will it be because Dany will effectively end up controlling the Narrow Sea with the Triarchy and Stepstones both under her, and given it constitutes a major trade route, Braavos wouldn't want it under the control of a single entity:

&gt; The Stepstones, the chain of rocky islands between Dorne and the
Disputed Lands of Essos, had long been a haunt of outlaws, exiles, wreckers,
and pirates. Of themselves the isles were of little worth, but placed as they
were, they controlled the sea lanes to and from the narrow sea, and merchant
ships passing through those waters were often preyed on by their inhabitants.

Worth noting that if this happens, this won't be the first time Braavos enters the war of Stepstones. Even during the time of Racallio Ryndoon, and the Daughter's War, Braavos had entered into the fray for Stepstones on behalf of Pentos.


##Loose Threads

This is a half-cooked idea based on just the above hints, yet to unravel how the the plot of Free Cities - Myr/Lys/Tyrosh/Pentos plays out in its entirety. How will this bloody roulette in Lys conclude? I don't know. Some players and threads which I think are Chekhov's guns in the Lys arc:

- Lynesse Hightower: Chief concubine of a merchant prince named Tregar Ormollen. Wife of Jorah and currently holds power enough that her brother is approaching her to get sellswords. Worth noting that one of the Rogares helped in the creation of the Bank of OldTown and since then, there are strong relations between Lys and the Hightowers.

- Varys: His history in Lys means it is likely he has a decent network of little birds over there, decent enough to turn the game.

- Salladhor Saan

- Any of the Rogare descendants. Particularly interesting to me was one Rogare who we saw comfortably settled in Old Volantis, where Dany is most likely going.

- Also and Dorne and Lys has had very close relations traditionally. From the Rogares who were the architect of Dornish alliance with Lys, to the Dornish during Aegon's Conquest who are supposed to have bought some weapons against the dragons from Lys, right to Oberyn who is supposed to have spent quite some time there. 

- Historically we have also seen more than a few sorceresses from Lys who played quite a role in the events of Westeros, Serenei, Mysaria, etc. Will we see one more?


I think there is a strong possibility that the Lys plot definitely carries over to Dorne and Reach, if not the Iron Throne.  Thoughts are welcome. ",1,(Spoilers Extended) Will Arya break the peace of Lys/Triarchy ?,8436,63

While the show skated over Dany's arc in the Riverlands, I think it is more than likely she tries to conquer Riverlands. Not only was Harrenhal a big pivotal point for both Aegon the Conqueror and Daemon Targaryen (both of whose footsteps Dany is significantly paralleling), we also have the following about Alys Rivers, Aemond's bedmate at Harrenhal: 

&gt; “Don’t come again unless you mean to bend your knees, she says. Any man who comes near her walls will die. There’s power in them stones, and the widow’s woken it. Seven save us all, she has a dragon. I seen it.”

Dany coming to Harrenhal might also bring about an interesting turn of events. At the moment, although Harrenhal is technically under the rule of LittleFinger (and he is unlikely to occupy it anytime soon, given his fear of Harrenhal's curse), the castle is fortified under Jaime's orders by armed men of the Faith led by none other than Bonifer Hasty. Bonifer who had fallen in love with Daenerys' mother, who had crowned her the Queen of Love and Beauty. And after Rhaella was forced to marry Aerys, Bonifer chose to become a man of the Faith saying

&gt; ""only the Maiden could replace Queen Rhaella in his heart.""

At the moment, Riverlands is filled with the armed Faith, broken men and Lannister men. All this is unlikely to change soon. Dany is unlikely to face a very stiff opposition over there. But why would Arya set Nymeria and her wolves on Dany's men if they are fighting Lannisters and the Faith?

To go there, first we need to get back to why Riverlands will be so important for Dany. Remember the only man who Dany cherishes with unblemished love, *Ser Willem Darry.* Ser Willem Darry who saved Daenerys and Viserys during the attack on Dragonstone, even though the entire garrison had sold out:

&gt; The garrison had been prepared to sell them to the Usurper, but one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them both, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the Braavosian coast.

Ser Willem Darry who was the only reason Dany had her early childhood days of happiness and safety:

&gt;She remembered Ser Willem dimly, a great grey bear of a man, half-blind, roaring and bellowing orders from his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but he had always been kind to Dany. He called her ""Little Princess"" and sometimes ""My Lady,"".. 

&gt;She could smell home, she could see it, there, just beyond that door, green fields and great stone houses and arms to keep her warm, there. She threw open the door...""Little princess, there you are,"" he said in his gruff kind voice. ""Come,"" he said, ""come to me, my lady, you're home now, you're safe now."" His big wrinkled hand reached for her, soft as old leather, and Dany wanted to take it and hold it and kiss it,


In fact, in Dany's mind, the only person who ever kept her safe. 

&gt; No one ever kept me safe when I was little. Well, Ser Willem did, but then he died...

Also Darrys are the amongst the handful of families who remained Targaryen loyalists even after the Rebellion, whose lands once upon a time stretched to as far as the Inn at the Crossroads. And after Robert came to power, they lost half their lands, most of their men and power. But they still remained staunch loyalists to this day, something which coincidentally Tyrion, Dany's advisor knows too:

&gt;  Tyrion had pointed out the squares of darker stone where tapestries had once hung. Ser Raymun could remove the hangings, but not the marks they'd left. Later, the Imp had slipped a handful of stags to one of Darry's serving men for the key to the cellar where the missing tapestries were hidden. He showed them to Jaime by the light of a candle, grinning; woven portraits of all the Targaryen kings, from the first Aegon to the second Aenys. ""If I tell Robert, mayhaps he'll make me Lord of Darry,"" the dwarf said, chortling.

In contrast, the Tullys were amongst the first in the Riverlands to turn against the Targaryens, even though they had been made Lords Paramount of the Riverlands by the Targaryens in the first place. Emotionally, Dany has every reason to increase the power of Darrys in contrast to the Tullys. 

But now the real conflicting part with Arya comes in. [Here's a look at the Darry family tree currently.](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Darry#House_Darry_at_the_end_of_the_third_century) There is just one male Darry alive, Lyman Darry who hates the Lannisters. And both of his cousins alive, Jeyne Darry and Mariya Darry are married to Freys. They in turn have 6 children, none of whom participated in the Red Wedding. Out of these 6 children, I will be focusing on the males- Tywin Frey and Willem Frey. 

Both of them are Lannister-Freys. After the redistribution of titles by the Lannisters after the Red Wedding, Tywin is the first in line to inherit the titles of Riverrun after Emmon dies. And the second in line to Tywin is Willem Darry-Frey, who is currently a page at Casterly Rock. If Tywin dies, Willem Darry-Frey will be in line to inherit both Riverrun and Castle Darry. *If there is someone to support his claim obviously.*

It is a common theory that a second red wedding will happen in which all of the Freys will be killed. But what if one particular Frey survives. A Frey neither who nor whose father has not participated in the Red Wedding, a Frey with direct claim to Riverrun and Darry. And if he is the only Frey alive, with direct claim to the Twins too. And won't just the name Willem Darry-Frey bring back her sweetest ghosts for Dany?

On the other hand, Arya has seen the Red Wedding in first hand, has seen her mother and brother being butchered by the Freys. Dany will not only be taking what she sees rightfully belongs to her uncle, but handing it right over to the enemies. Never mind that the said person or their immediate family weren't a part of the wedding massacre. Also Arya seems to have unfriendly thoughts about Castle Darry even before any of this ever happened. Foreshadowing?

&gt;Arya was glad to hear that the castle of the Darrys would be burned. That was where they'd brought her when she'd been caught after her fight with Joffrey, and where the queen had made her father kill Sansa's wolf. It deserves to burn. 

In the passage about the wolves' history in riverlands, the wolves came out in support of the Darrys against the Andals. 

&gt; Songs speak to us through the years of the Fall of Maidenpool and the death of its boy king, Florian the Brave, Fifth of That Name; of the Widow's Ford, where three sons of Lord Darry held back the Andal warlord Vorian Vypren and his knights for a day and a night, slaying hundreds before they fell themselves; of the night in the White Wood, where supposedly the children of the forest emerged from beneath a hollow hill to send hundreds of wolves against an Andal camp, tearing hundreds of men apart beneath the light of a crescent moon;


What if this time the wolves come out against the Darrys. I also wonder if Arya's faceless man skills of poisoning and the Brotherhood Without Banners play a role as well in taking the Riverlands back for the Tullys. Needless to say, I doubt through all of this Dany will know who really is the behind the wolves or the assassinations. ",1,(Spoilers Extended) About those wolves in the Riverlands,7630,56

0,1,0,49,201,"# Introduction

A while back there was a post about our favorite subtle allusions in ASOIAF, and I mentioned *Huck Finn*.  A few posters were curious to see a longer writeup of the parallels -- so here it is. =)

The chapters detailing Aegon’s travels on the Rhoyne have often been noted by astute readers as containing references to another famous river trip - Mark Twain’s *“The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.”*

There are obvious parallels in narrative and the imagery GRRM chooses: Young GrifFinn wears an iconic straw hat and travels down a river on a barge having adventures.

If these similarities weren’t blatant enough, GRRM drops this bit in ADWD:

&gt;The Upper Rhoyne was full of snags and **Sawyers**, any one of which could rip out the Shy Maid's hull. Griff did not want to hear it. What he wanted was Volantis.

A sawyer is an unusual and archaic word -- “a fallen tree stuck on the bottom of a river, where it constitutes a danger to boating”  -- it’s also of course the name of Huck Finn’s partner in crime Tom Sawyer.

Most people assume the connections stop here, and that these cheeky winks are just a cute cosmetic reference, like the Wheel of Time or Harry Potter easter eggs.

However, when you dig deeper into *Huck Finn,* you can find connections to a popular tinfoil subplot:

**\*\*I believe Young Griff’s similarity to Huck Finn is actually an intentional subtextual clue to his Blackfyre lineage. \*\***

The story of Huck Finn contains thematic and narrative elements that GRRM may have purposefully drawn from in crafting the Blackfyre subplot.   George is known to do this - he draws heavily from English and French history as well has various mythologies both for world-building inspiration and specific plot points. I believe that GRRM included the *Huck Finn* references because he was amused by the cleverness of the thematic parallels with the Blackfyre story.

""*The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*"" isn’t just the story of a kid floating down a river -- it features mistaken identities, blood feuds between two aristocratic houses and the extermination of the male bloodline of one, and a pair of con artists who falsely pretend to be royalty ""the duke and the king"" and put on a mummers show to scam money.  These themes are reflected as in a dark mirror in GRRMs secret fAegon Blackfyre subplot.

# The False Nephew

The core conceit of the blackfyre conspiracy theory is that fAegon is not the long lost son of Rhaegar, but in fact a descendant of the bastard Blackfyre line, found by Varys or the Golden Company(depending who you ask), and put forward as a pretender in order to hijack the throne.

So how is Finn similar to fAegon?

Both Young Griff and Finn falsely pretend to be the Nephew of an influential family to cheat them.

*Huck Finn’s* plot is rife with cases of mistaken identity, disguises, con-men, and pretenders.  However the most notable is his identity swap with the infamous Tom Sawyer.   Near the climax of the story Finn arrives in a distant town and insinuates himself into a wealthy family by pretending to be the Nephew of Aunt Sally and Uncle Silas Phelps.  He uses this position to help effect the escape of his friend Jim from slavery.

Why does this matter?

The true Aegon would be Daenerys’ nephew -- but Young GrifFinn isn’t truly her nephew, he’s a fake.  The mistaken identity in *Huck Finn* is paralleled in fAegon’s false claim and attempt to steal the throne from Danny.

And this isn’t the only such clue -- *Huck Finn* features other cons and pretenders, even some who claim, laughably, to be nobility.

# Noble Pretenders and Stolen Inheritance

In *Huck Finn* two con artists “The Duke and the King” pretend to be royalty and perform various stunts to rob people.

They introduce themselves as the long-lost heirs of noble houses, one to the Duke of Bridgewater, the other as the Lost Dauphin, the King of France Louis XVII.

Louis XVII’s actual history is of keen interest here, and with it we start to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.

**History of the Lost Dauphin**

During the French Revolution, where the long standing dynastic monarchy was overthrown, Louis XVI was imprisoned and executed.  Louis XVII was actually the second son of the king, but his elder brother had died leaving him as heir apparent.

Little Louis-Charles was technically recognized as King by the nobles but never ruled and was kept imprisoned by the new Republic government.  This is where the conspiracy theories start to spring up.

Immediately after his father’s death, plots were hatched to free Louis-Charles from confinement, but these came to nothing at the time, and eventually he died of illness in captivity under mysterious circumstances -- it being suspected that his doctor was murdered by poison.  However, popular theories abounded in the day and for many years afterward of **conspiracies to smuggle the child out of confinement in the Temple tower.**  They proposed that the autopsy and burial records had been falsified, and that in fact the boy had lived and been spirited away.

Rumours abound and when the monarchy was restored some 20 years later, hundreds of claimants pretending to be the “Lost Dauphin” came forward to attempt to take the throne.

**GRRM The Histrogrifter**

This is perhaps one of the most famous stories of a lost prince in European history, and GRRM would certainly have studied it in preparing his narrative around the Targaryen Restoration. It’s well established that he based the history of westeros on English and French history and this plot could not have been overlooked.

Thus, the appearance of a Dauphin pretender in *Huck Finn* can be taken as something GRRM would have noted, given he’s included references to Huck in fAegon’s chapters.  Here is an obviously false claimant pretending to be the long-lost heir of a royal bloodline whose throne is about to be restored - a juicy intrigue to parallel in his own story!

And indeed, in fAegon we have an heir presumed dead after a revolution, only to supposedly have been spirited away by Varys during the sack of King’s Landing, and appearing later as a false claimant when the original line is restored.  The similarity to Louis Charles is stunning.

**Scammers, Swindlers, and Mummers**

The antics of the “Duke and the King” provide the basis for other allusions in *ASOIAF* as well.

Later in the story the group arrives in the town of the primary target -- a recently deceased nobleman who has left a large inheritance to his daughters.  The “Duke” pretends to be the missing heir of this nobleman to swindle the Heiresses of their fortune -- again paralleled by fAegon’s royal pretensions attempting to steal the Iron Throne from Daenerys.  But of course, the Duke, like fAegon, is a fraud.

The two con-men engage in a variety of schemes, one of which involves putting on a play -- or **mummer’s farce,** if you will -- entitled “The Royal Nonesuch” -- ie a play about false royalty.  The play is a bawdy flop and complete ripoff of the town’s populace, and they eventually have to flee for their lives or risk being hung.

These themes are also hinted at in the Duke and King’s theatrical fumbles -- in addition to the “Royal  Nonesesuch” the pair practices scenes from *Romeo and Juliet, Richard III,* and *Macbeth*, the former of course being the archetypal tale of feuding families (which we will revisit shortly), while the later two are again stories about wars to usurp a throne.

These theatrical elements have been worked into AOSIAF via references to fAegon as the “Mummer’s Dragon”, and parallels in his story to those of Richard and Macbeth.  It has been theorized that, just as the townspeople turn on the Duke and Dauphin when they learn the truth, the people of Westeros will turn on fAegon when his false identity is revealed.

# Family Feud and the Extermination of a Male Bloodline

So we’ve established the falseness of fAegon’s claim, but how do we get to the Blackfyres, specifically?

The answer comes from another conflict Huck stumbles upon during his adventures.

The Blackfyres were a branch house of the Targaryen dynasty, started from a bastard line.  After the wars that settled the legitimacy of their claim, they retreated into the east, and ultimately the male bloodline was believed to have been wiped out.   Did GRRM draw inspiration from *Huck Finn* for this part of the story as well?

*Huck Finn’s* parallel to the Targaryens and Blackfyres comes in the form of the conflict between the Shephersons and Grangerfords.   These two bitter rival families are engaged in a 30 year blood feud, and Huck quickly becomes entangled in their war.  Notably, the Grangerfords have a son Huck’s age who he befriends, and is then shocked to see gunned down in a firefight.  Like the Blackfyres, the males of the Grangerford family are wiped out, ending the feud.   This section can also be seen as an additional reference to *Romeo and Juliet*, as the final confrontation is kicked off by a forbidden tryst between children from opposing families.

If GRRM is drawing on Huck as a model for fAegon, then this conflict should play a prominent role in his story. fAegon should be not just a royal pretender, but a pretender tangled up in a long standing blood feud between two aristocratic families -- the Blackfyres and Targaryens.

One other subtle hint in *Huck Finn* supports the idea that fAegon is from a bastard royal line.

During their elaborate plot to break Jim out of captivity, Huck and Tom form a secret nation, complete with a royal coat-of-arms.  Among the many superfluous and conflicting components of the crest, Tom insists they include a ""bar sinister"" -- the mark of a bastard line.

# Finn and the Future

So we’ve established a strong connection between *Huck Finn’s* narrative and the Blackfyre subplot in *ASOIAF* \-- but what might these parallels say about the future of fAegon’s story?

At least two plotlines from *Huck Finn* appear to be relevant here.

The ending of *Huck Finn* centers on the plot to free Jim from slavery out from under Tom’s Aunt Sally (which, you recall, parallels Danny as fAegons ‘aunt’).  Tom hatches an absurdly complicated plan based on his ideas from romantic adventure stories.

This romanticism is reflected in Young Griff’s naivete and impulsiveness, traits that will likely lead to his downfall.  In wanting to live out his romanticized vision of a great Conquering King, fAegon will be led to make unrealistic and foolish decisions.  fAegon’s ultimate fate will likely be failure and defeat, brought on by his own naivete.  Like Tom and Huck, he will act based on how he imagines a romanticized story would go, rather than on the practicalities of the situation, and in the end will be betrayed by the cold hard reality.

The second portion of *Huck Finn* that may become relevant is the fate of the Duke and King when their frauds are discovered.  In the case of the “Royal Nonesuch”, they are run out of town at risk to their lives when the people discover they’ve been swindled.

It’s quite possible that fAegon’s claim will be delegitimized in some way, and the people of Westeros will turn against him. Where they first hailed him as a hero, once his true identity is discovered they will resent being duped and rise up against his claim.

How might this happen?

As a final spurious bit of tinfoil- in attempting to identify the true identity of the Duke after trying to steal the girls’ inheritance, the town is forced to exhume the dead brother’s body for evidence.  While we can’t say for certain this detail would have any bearing on GRRM’s plot, it could perhaps be read as a hint about the identity of some trueborn heir in a certain crypt…

Were several claimants to all argue for their legitimacy, it would be a beautiful and subtle allusion on GRRMs part to mimic *Huck Finn* again in the conclusion of fAegon’s arc, and have Jon emerge as the true heir as a result of evidence exhumed from the Crypts of winterfell.

We've witnessed this bloody conflict firsthand: Robb marching south to free Ned, the Mountain ravaging the Riverlands, Sansa held hostage in King's Landing, Arya on the run - it's the catalyst for *A Song of Ice and Fire*.

My question is whether it's time to let it go.

Random House, with its current technology, can only bind up to around 1,500 manuscript pages without significant errors.  For Winds and Dream, that means the story must either end in around 3,000 manuscript pages or else carry over into more books.  That's two Dance-sized books to resolve all the remaining plot threads.

With that in mind, is it time for Cersei's story to end?

The Lannister regime is on the brink of collapse.  Their alliance with the Reach has reached its breaking point.  Kevan and Pycelle have been assassinated.  Targaryen restorationists have landed on the shores of Westeros.  Nymeria and Tyene Sand are on their way to King's Landing with Myrcella.  The stage is set for the Dance of Dragons 2.0 when Dany returns.  Winds is the perfect opportunity to close this arc, kill Cersei, and enter the endgame.

There is a cost to this ending.  It will rob Tyrion of any catharsis he might have interacting with Cersei again.  We may never see Casterly Rock.  But it would clear the way for an ending in Dream, if that should ever come, where a much greater focus can be placed on the Others without Cersei Lannister in the periphery.

At the end of *Fire &amp; Blood*, Aegon III has a full 7 Kingsguards once again. I had a hard time keeping track of who were the Kingsguards, who they served and how many of them there were during and after the Dance, so I decided to make a list.

&amp;#x200B;

# TL;DR

**Rhaenyra had 8 different Queensguards (all died during the Dance).**

**Aegon II had 10 different Kingsguards during his short reign (129 - 131 AC) and only 2 became part of Aegon III's Kingsguard.**

**Aegon III had 14 different Kingsguards by the end of** ***Fire and Blood*** **(136 AC).**

**In total there were 30 King/Queensguards for the period of 129 - 136 AC. That's a lot!**

&amp;#x200B;

# Rhaenyra's Queensguard

When Rhaenyra declares herself Queen she creates her own Queensguard. Rhaenyra had 8 different Queensguards during the Dance, 3 of which were Kingsguard for her father Viserys I. They all died by the time of Rhaenyra's death in 130 AC.

* Ser Steffon Darklyn died in 129 AC at Dragonstone.
* Ser Lorent Marbrand died in 130 AC at King's Landing.
* Ser Glendon Goode died in 130 AC at King's Landing.
* Ser Erryk Cargyll died in 129 AC at Dragonstone.
* Ser Lyonel Bentley died in 130 AC in between Stokeworth and Duskendale.
* Ser Harrold Darke died in 130 AC at Dragonstone.
* Ser Adrian Redfort died in 130 AC at Dragonstone.
* Ser Loreth Lansdale died in 130 AC at Dragonstone.

# Aegon II's Kingsguard

Aegon II inherited the 7 Kingsguards of Viserys I but Lorent Marbrand and Erryk Cargyll were on Dragonstone when the Dance began and they joined Rhaenyra's Queensguard. Steffon Darklyn ran away from King's Landing to join Rhaenyra's cause as well.

This mean Aegon II started the Dance with 4 Kingsguards:

* Ser Criston Cole, he died in 130 AC at the battle known as the Butcher's Ball.
* Ser Arryk Cargyll, he died in 129 AC at Dragonstone.
* Ser Rickard Thorne, he died in 130 AC at Bitterbridge.
* Ser Willis Fell, he survived the Dance.

At the time of Aegon II's death in 131 AC, it is noted that Aegon II had 7 Kingsguards. However, Criston, Arryk and Rickard died before that. So, 6 new Kingsguards had to be named during the period 129 - 131 AC.

* Ser Gyles Belgrave is named in either 129 or 130 AC and he is executed for treason in 131 AC at King's Landing.
* Ser Marston Waters is named into the Kingsguard in 130 AC, he survived the Dance.
* Unknown first Kingsguard executed for treason in 131 AC at King's Landing alongside Ser Gyles Belgrave.
* Unknown second Kingsguard executed for treason in 131 AC at King's Landing alongside Ser Gyles Belgrave.
* Unknown third Kingsguard executed for treason in 131 AC at King's Landing alongside Ser Gyles Belgrave.
* Unknown fourth Kingsguard executed for treason in 131 AC at King's Landing alongside Ser Gyles Belgrave.

&amp;#x200B;

# Aegon III's Kingsguard

&gt;Ser Willis Fell, the sole survivor of the Kingsguard of King Viserys’s time, was made Lord Commander of the White Swords, with Ser Marston Waters as his second. As both men were considered greens, the remaining places in the Kingsguard were filled with blacks.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Fire and Blood Volume 1, Under the Regents - The Hooded Hand*

&amp;#x200B;

In 131 AC Willis Fell is named as Lord Commander, Marston Waters stays in the Kingsguard and 5 new Kingsguard are named:

1. Ser Raynard Ruskyn, he is still alive by the end of Fire &amp; Blood (136 AC) and becomes Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
2. Ser Regis Groves, he dies at Harrenhal in 132 AC.
3. Unknown third Kingsguard named in 131 AC, he dies of Winter Fever in 132 or 133 AC alongside Willis Fell and one other Kingsguard.
4. Unknown fourth Kingsguard named in 131 AC, he dies of Winter Fever in 132 or 133 AC alongside Willis Fell and one other Kingsguard.
5. Unknown fifth Kingsguard named in 131 AC.

&amp;#x200B;

With the death of Ser Regis Groves at Harrenhal and Willis Fell and 2 others due to Winter Fever, Aegon had to name 4 replacements in 133 AC. Aegon wanted to name Ser Robert Darklyn and Ser Robin Massey but the Hand of the King Unwin Peake disaproved and named 2 of his relatives instead. So the 4 new Kingsguards in 133 AC are:

1. Ser Amaury Peake, nephew of Unwin Peake. He died in 135 AC during the Lysene Spring.
2. Ser Mervyn Flowers, half brother of Unwin Peake. He died in 135 AC during the Lysene Spring.
3. Unknown third Kingsguard named in 135 AC.
4. Unknown fourth Kingsguard named in 135 AC.

During the Lysene Spring (135 AC), Amaury Peake, Mervyn Flowers and Marston Waters died. Raynard Ruskyn replaced Marston Waters as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and 3 new Kingsguards are named to replace the 3 dead:

* Ser Edmund Warrick
* Ser Dennis Whitfield
* Ser Agramore Cobb

&amp;#x200B;

**To sum up, at the end of Fire &amp; Blood Aegon III had 7 Kingsguards : Lord Commander Raynard Ruskyn, Ser Edmund Warrick, Ser Dennis Whitfield, Ser Agramore Cobb and 3 unknown.**

They violate Dornish borders with their dragons, with troops, and they continually look down upon the Dornish people and culture.  Rhaenys is even described as a victim, when in reality it's more like oppressed, colonized people getting revenge on a colonizer who keeps trying to destroy and steal their country.

So why would Dorne bow to Dany or Jon or both?  By marrying a Martell to Dany, at least Dorne can once again have direct Dornish blood on the throne and get revenge on the Lannisters and by proxy the Baratheons.  It's not just Elia and her children who died, but thousands of Dornishmen who were killed in the war against the rebels, so by getting revenge on the leaders of the rebels..it makes some sense.  Supporting Dany, even without a marriage, okay...I can see it in an attempt to get revenge on the Lannisters.

But why bow once Dany gets revenge on the Lannisters if she doesn't marry a Dornishman? The Targs have continuously insulted and treated the Dornish terribly, even with two royal marriages, for nearly 300 years, arguably more so than any other region.  Furthermore, the Targs don't keep to Dornish customs, with female inheritance and more female equality.  Why put themselves under Targ rule once again, when it's nearly impossible to invade Dorne and they've proven in the past to be able to resist dragons?  And I see people argue that the Yronwoods dislike the Martells, but the Yronwoods were besieged by Aegon I, were the ones who shot down Merxes, etc., so they have no particular love for the Targaryens either.  

And in our world, children don't carry the sins of the parents, but in Westeros...even the more forgiving Dorne isn't going to want to bend the knee to the son of the man who abandoned their princess and children to go fuck his mistress in Dorne of all places—especially when Dornishmen were dying in a war sparked by their affair—and said mistress who decided her happiness was more important than Elia or her children's future.  Especially when they were holed up for several months until the end of the war, and perhaps if they had emerged could have stopped the war....At least Aegon is part Dornish, but Jon is 100% the product of two people who insulted a Dornish princess and committed said insult on Dornish land.

Edit: The quote is:

&gt;She had to leave now, she told herself, but when the moment came, she was too frightened to move.

&gt;***Calm as still water***, a small voice whispered in her ear. Arya was so startled she almost dropped her bundle. She looked around wildly, but there was no one in the stable but her, and the horses, and the dead men.

&gt;***Quiet as a shadow***, she heard. Was it her own voice, or Syrio’s? She could not tell, yet somehow it calmed her fears.

A later passage in the same chapter:

&gt;***Fear cuts deeper than swords***, the quiet voice inside her whispered. Suddenly Arya remembered the crypts at Winterfell. They were a lot scarier than this place, she told herself. She’d been just a little girl the first time she saw them. Her brother Robb had taken them down, her and Sansa and baby Bran, who’d been no bigger than Rickon was now.

This memory that the voice triggered is interesting. Arya remembers a time that Jon scared them as a ghost, and between Arya, Sansa, and Bran, she was the only one who saw through it and wasn't afraid. But as much as this was a character-defining moment for Arya, it must've been very influential on Jon and Bran too. Jon chose to name his direwolf after this prank, whether consciously or not. But it's a moment that exposed baby Bran to fear for the first time.

&gt; When the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white and moaning for blood, Sansa ran shrieking for the stairs, and Bran wrapped himself around Robb’s leg, sobbing. Arya stood her ground and gave the spirit a punch. It was only Jon, covered with flour. “You *stupid*,” she told him, “you scared the baby,” but Jon and Robb just laughed and laughed, and pretty soon **Bran and Arya** were laughing too.

It's an important memory that Bran and Arya shared together. A moment when Arya helped Bran conquer fear. George does some of his best storytelling in these kinds of passages. We wouldn't know it at the time, but with hindsight we would wonder if George was being clever and deliberate by choosing to write this specific Bran-related scene to embolden Arya.

A few years ago, I posted a [well-received piece](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/419j2y/spoilers_all_who_is_howland_reed_a_thorough/) arguing that Howland Reed is ""currently"" disguised as the hedge knight Ser Shadrich, The Mad Mouse of Shady Glen (while dismissing the idea that Howland is the High Sparrow, as some claim). *(If you haven't read that post, don't bother. This post supercedes and replaces that one, save for its debunking of the idea that Howland is the High Sparrow, which you can still peruse there if that topic interests you.)* In the years after I wrote that piece, novel nuggets of evidence supporting its thesis continued to regularly reveal themselves. Eventually so many had piled up that I realized that the original post, while still fundamentally correct, was hopelessly obsolete, and so I set about writing this piece: a new, hopefully definitive version of my argument that Shadrich and Howland Reed are one and the same.

- What's new here?

I proffer novel evidence for my claim that crannogmen are often redheads, like Ser Shadrich, a key piece of which may cause you to smack your own forehead. I also show that an improbable number of (additional) parallels are created between the ""Vale Tourney plot"" of ASOIAF and the short story *The Mystery Knight* if and only if Shadrich is indeed Howland Reed—thus suggesting that Shadrich surely *is* the Lord of Greywater Watch. Finally, I argue that based on some fascinating real-world historical parallels, there is excellent reason to believe that when we first meet Howland/""Ser Shadrich"" in the company of the merchant Hibald and his ""serving men"", Howland is in fact transporting Ned Stark's bones to the Quiet Isle for safe keeping.

#Howland Reed 101
Howland Reed was…
&gt;…one of [Ned Stark]'s staunchest companions during the war for King Robert's crown… (COK B III)

Having famously saved Ned's life at the Tower of Joy—
&gt;""…Ser Arthur Dayne… would have killed me but for Howland Reed."" - Ned (COK B III)

—Howland has supposedly been living a quiet and reclusive life:
&gt;Howland Reed the crannogman… had not set foot outside his swamps for many a year… (COK B II)

#Howland Reed 102: Appearance
If Howland is now abroad, how might we recognize him?

##""The Little Crannogman""
For one thing, Howland is almost surely small and *very* short.

TWOIAF says the crannogmen are ""small in stature"". (TWOIAF) Ned calls Howland """"the little crannogman"" twice, and Meera calls Howland the same thing nine times. (GOT E I, X; SOS B II) Meera also also says Howland was ""small like all crannogmen"". (SOS B II) Even when a couple years had passed since he had ""grown to manhood"", he was smaller than all three of the much younger squires who accosted him at the Harrenhal Tourney:
&gt;The **little** crannogman was walking across the field, enjoying the warm spring day and harming none, when he was set upon by **three squires. They were none older than fifteen, yet even so they were bigger than him, all three.** (ibid.)

Jojen and Meera Reed are similarly small:
&gt;Both Reeds were slight of build, **slender as swords and scarcely taller than Bran** himself. (COK B III)

At that point in the story, Jojen is either thirteen or very close to thirteen and Meera is ""almost sixteen, a woman grown"", while Bran is not quite nine, yet Bran is almost as tall as both of them. (SOS B I; COK B IV) Given his children's builds, it's likely that Howland is not only *very* short but also slender, which would be apt, since per Ned Stark himself nothing is so quintessentially slender as a ""Reed"":
&gt;Ser Loras Tyrell was **slender as a reed**… (GOT E VII)

##""Strong""
Meera says that despite his small size, Howland Reed was *strong*:
&gt;He was small like all crannogmen, but brave and smart and **strong as well**.  (SOS B II)

##Howland's Look: Like Jojen, Not Meera
While we're not told much about what Howland looks like, we get a better look at the Reed children.

Coupling the fact that Meera's and Jojen's builds are conflated—
&gt;**Both Reeds** were slight of build, slender as swords and scarcely taller than Bran himself. (COK B III)

—with the fact that Meera is ""flat as a boy"", it seems that from the neck down, Jojen and Meera are virtually twins. (SOS B I) Yet they *aren't* virtual twins overall. Despite describing their bodies identically, Bran never implies the two have the same look in the way, say, Cersei thinks that the equally slender Margaery and Loras Tyrell ""could be twins"". (FFC C III) To the contrary, by telling us that Bran imagines young Howland looking specifically like an older, strong *Jojen*—
&gt;In his head, **the crannogman [Howland] looked like *Jojen*, only older and stronger** and dressed like Meera. (SOS B II)

—ASOIAF coyly implies that, interchangeable physiques aside, Meera and Jojen look quite obviously different from one another, at least above the shoulders.

##*Does* Howland Look Like A ""Stronger"" Jojen? Almost Certainly.
It's worth mentioning that we can probably trust Bran's instinct that Howland looks like Jojen. Sure, if we were reading a transcription of someone's real-world thoughts, his intuition would be irrelevant speculation. But we're reading a work of dramatic fiction, and moreover we're hearing a super-psychic's thoughts about one of the story's most enigmatic characters. Thus Bran's belief that Howland resembles ""Jojen, only older and strong"", is likely to be simple fact, especially since we still lack a complete picture of what Jojen looks like—a dearth that is a dramatic necessity if learning certain details of his appearance might give away Howland's identity.

##Howland's Look: Green Eyes
Meera and Jojen both have green eyes, so it seems likely that Howland has green eyes, too. It's notable, however, that despite Bran's crush on Meera, Bran's POV chapters mention her eyes only once, calling her, simply, ""green-eyed"". (SOS B I) Jojen's eyes, though, are described in greater detail on no less than eight occasions. They're ""large"", ""unafraid"", (repeatedly) ""the color of moss"", ""strange"", ""green pools full of sorrow"", ""murky as moss"", ""dark green"", etc. (COK B III, IV, V, VI; SOS B I, IV)

This discrepancy is consistent with the notion that Jojen and Meera's faces aren't particularly similar. At the same time, given that they both have some form of green eyes, it seems doubtful that the difference in their eyes alone can account for Bran implying Jojen and Meera look quite different.

Their hair though, is a different story.

##Howland's Look: *Not* Brown Hair
In light of the attention lavished on Jojen's eyes, it's beyond suspicious that Jojen's hair color *is never mentioned*—whereas Meera is twice said to have ""brown hair"". (COK B III; SOS B I) If Howland Reed's hair is simply brown, like Meera's, withholding Jojen's hair color serves no dramatic purpose, since readers will already assume Howland's hair is brown, like Meera's.

On the other hand, it makes perfect sense to withhold Jojen's hair color if Jojen and Howland are *gingers,* since Jojen's red hair would be a huge clue as to Howland's present identity. Keeping Jojen's hair color a secret also allows Meera's brown hair to serve as a red herring.

Right away we can see a bit of in-world justification for Bran's silence regarding Jojen's hair color: We see Jojen in Bran's POVs, and Bran, his mother, and most of his siblings are redheads—
&gt;**Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys**, with easy smiles and **fire in their hair.** (GOT A I)

—so while red hair is noteworthy to most people, it could be (literally) unremarkable to Bran. (thanks /u/Darkstar_k)

Jojen having ""not-brown"" hair would be entirely consistent with Bran implying that Jojen and Meera look quite different, and Howland *sharing* Jojen's not-brown hair color would be consistent with Bran's intuition that Howland looks specifically like Jojen rather than Meera.

Setting aside the idea that Jojen being a redhead could explain Bran-the-redhead's *silence* regarding his hair, why should we think Howland and Jojen have red hair? Because there are two good reasons to believe the crannogmen *in general* are often redheaded.

##Crannogmen Are Redheads, Part 1: Earth's Redheaded Crannogmen
First, it so happens that the ""crannogmen"" of planet Earth are the most redheaded people on the planet—and also stereotypically green-eyed (like Jojen and Meera). Crannogs are a phenomenon associated with Ireland (and to a lesser extent Scotland):
&gt;**What Is A Crannog?**

&gt;The term refers to an artificial island built in a lake. These are some of the oldest dwelling places of humans in prehistoric Ireland.

&gt;They are found in Ireland, and to a lesser extent in Scotland, with a couple of isolated examples in Wales and Scandinavia, but it is safe to say that Ireland had the largest concentration of them in the world. (http://www.enjoy-irish-culture.com/Crannog.html)

It ""just so happens"" the crannogmen of earth—the Irish and the Scots—are known for having far and away the highest incidence of red hair on earth (aside from a tiny group called the Udmurt in Russia). The red-headed Irishman is a timeworn cliche. It makes sense that GRRM might also associate crannogs and redheads in ASOIAF.

A redhead having *green eyes* (like Jojen's) is likewise a cliche—especially as regards the people of the earthly crannogs: the Irish. It even has [an entry on (the terribly-named) tvtropes.org](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantGreenEyedRedhead?from=Main). GRRM indulges in this very cliche: both the Titan's Bastard and (green-garbed, ""strong and slender"", crannogman-sized) Rohanne Webber of *The Sworn Sword* are green-eyed redheads.

There are a couple reasons to believe GRRM is indeed basing his crannogmen on the redheads found in the lands of earth's crannogs. First, many Christians, especially in England, once associated red hair and green eyes with demons and the devil. This was likely related to the fact that the pagan Celts—earth's crannogmen—who resisted English dominion for centuries, often had red hair and green eyes. And what do the ironborn call the crannogmen? *""Bog devils.""*

Second, Theon gives us a litany of names of the noble houses of the Neck:
&gt;Just as dangerous were its people, seldom seen but always lurking, the swamp-dwellers, the frog-eaters, the mud-men. **Fenn and Reed, Peat and Boggs, Cray and Quagg, Greengood and Blackmyre**, those were the sorts of names they gave themselves. The ironborn called them all bog devils. (DWD R II)

Almost all those words are riffs on things having to do with swamps, right? Fenn as in a fen. Boggs as in a bog. Quagg as in a quag. Blackmyre as in a mire. Greengood at least alludes to nature.

""Cray"" stands out. While it could argued that ""Cray"" implies crayfish—often found in swamps—it's also a common real world family name that just so happens to be *Irish*—an anglicized version of Ó Craobhaigh. (There also are no ""crayfish"" in ASOIAF, although there are ""crawfish"".) (TWOIAF)

Between crannogs, the ""bog devils"" and the ""Crays"", I think it's pretty clear GRRM's crannogmen are connected with the stereotypically red-headed, green-eyed Irish. But perhaps a better reason to believe the crannogmen are redheads is because the only crannogman we meet other than the Reeds *is a redhead*. Say what?

##Crannogmen Are Redheads, Part 2: Bowen Marsh, Crannogman
If the crannogmen have names like Fenn, Reed, Peat and Boggs—and if, moreover, the Neck was once ruled by ""The Marsh Kings""—where do you suppose the chief steward of the Night's Watch, Bowen *Marsh* is from? (TWOIAF) I don't think there can be much dispute: he's a crannogman, from the Neck.

The [official repository of ASOIAF heralry at westeros.org](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/Heraldry/Houses/2/#In) includes House Marsh among the noble houses of the North and lists their arms as ""10 frogs, 4-3-2-1, green on yellow."" Recall that Bran says the crannogmen are ""frog-hunters"" and Theon calls them ""frog-eaters"". (COK B III; DWD R II)

The name ""Bowen"" itself hints that Bowen is a crannogman (and that the crannogmen are the Irish of Westeros). It has twin Gaelic origins: Irish and Welsh, and it's redolent of the name of a 16th-century Irish castle called Craggaun*owen* which just so happens to be a well-known tourist attraction containing a reconstruction of *a crannog*.

When Bowen rides to meet the Weeper at the Bridge of Skulls, Pyp says Bowen forced him to stay behind because ""he thinks I'm too small and green."" (SOS J VI) This becomes nicely ironic if Bowen's a crannogmen, given that the crannogmen themselves are (a) small and (b) heavily associated with the color green. It's also as if Bowen likened Pyp to a frog: *prey* to a Marsh of the Neck.

If it's perchance objected that because Bowen is ""round"" and ""plump"", he cannot possibly be a crannogman, given that the crannogmen are of ""small stature"", TWOIAF clearly states that the crannogmen are small because of their poor diets:
&gt;…some say they are small in stature because they intermarried with the children of the forest, but **more likely it results from inadequate nourishment**, for grains do not flourish amidst the fens and swamps and salt marshes of the Neck, and the crannogmen subsist largely upon a diet of fish, frogs, and lizards…

People who subsist on calorie and/or nutrient restricted diets often gain a lot of weight when they gain access to more and better food, getting fat, just like Bowen Marsh.

While Bowen's height isn't directly mentioned, there are three subtle hints that he is short, like a typical crannogman. First, he's called ""round"". (GOT Ty III) It's obviously easier to be ""round"" if one if short. Second, the way Jon notices that Wick Whittlestick is ""tall and skinny"" when he's standing next to Bowen can be read as implying that Bowen is *short* in addition to being ""plump"":
&gt;Bowen Marsh was waiting at a junction where four wormways met. With him he had Wick Whittlestick, tall and skinny as a spear. (DWD J IV)

Finally, when Wick and Bowen stab Jon, Wick ""slashed at his throat"", whereas Bowen stabs Jon ""in the belly"", which is consistent with Bowen being a short crannogman. (DWD J XIII)

###Bowen Marsh, Redhead
Now, what are we told about Bowen Marsh the crannogman, over and over? *That he's a (red) pomegranate:*
&gt;""Not so,"" objected the Lord Steward, Bowen Marsh, a man as round and **red as a pomegranate.** (GOT Ty III)
***
&gt;**The Old Pomegranate** was amiable, and a diligent First Steward, but he was woefully ill-suited to face a wildling host. (SOS J VI
***
&gt;**The Old Pomegranate** himself had been carried back to the Shadow Tower sorely wounded.  (SOS J IX)
***
&gt;Bowen Marsh edged his mount up next to Jon's. ""This is a day I never thought to see."" **The Lord Steward had thinned notably** since suffering a head wound at the Bridge of Skulls. Part of one ear was gone. **He no longer looks much like a pomegranate**, Jon thought. (DWD J III)
***
&gt;As Bowen Marsh trotted off, [Edd] nodded toward his back and said, ""**Pomegranates.** All those seeds. A man could choke to death. I'd sooner have a turnip. Never knew a turnip to do a man any harm."" (DWD J V)

The first passage above makes it clear that pomegranates are quintessentially red, as do *The Sworn Sword*—
&gt;It made the boy blush **redder than a pomegranate**.

—and Sansa when Littlefinger eats pomegranate seeds—
&gt;""There's a clever girl."" He smiled, his thin lips **bright red from the pomegranate** seeds. (SOS San VI)

—which somehow happens about three pages before we read about Littlefinger's smallfolk living near a crannogman-evoking ""peat bog"".

Bowen Marsh's hair color is never directly stated, but given that he's constantly called a pomegranate and is first described as *generally* ""round and red as a pomegranate"", it certainly makes sense that he's a ginger.

With that possibility and my earlier comments regarding earthly crannogmen in mind, the passage in which his nickname is explained becomes particularly suspicious:
&gt;**Dolorous Edd sometimes called Marsh ""the Old Pomegranate,"" which fit him just as well as ""the Old Bear"" fit Mormont.** ""He's the man you want in front when the foes are in the field,"" Edd would say in his usual dour voice. ""He'll count them right up for you. A regular **demon** for counting, that one."" (SOS J V)

First, Edd so happens to casually refer to Bowen as a ""demon"", which is in keeping with ASOIAF's crannogmen being ""bog devils"".

Second, why would GRRM have Jon think Bowen's red-hued nickname fits him perfectly (for clearly that's what he means when he says it ""fit him just as well as 'the Old Bear' fit Mormont"") if Bowen is a blonde or a brunette? For Bowen's nickname to be as apt as Jon thinks, Bowen surely *must* be a redhead.

It may be objected that Bowen is *only* called red as a pomegranate because of his red face and roundness, per passages like these:
&gt;Behind them came the senior members of the three orders: **red-faced Bowen Marsh** the Lord Steward, First Builder Othell Yarwyck, and Ser Jaremy Rykker, who commanded the rangers in the absence of Benjen Stark. (GOT J VI)
***
&gt;And commanding them would be **red-faced Bowen Marsh**, the **plump** Lord Steward who had been made castellan in Lord Mormont's absence. (SOS J V)

Certainly ASOIAF *invites* that misinterpretation, as GRRM does not want to spell out the fact that crannogmen are often redheads, lest Howland's identity be given away too easily. And certainly Bowen's complexion is part of the reason his epithet is so apt. No one is denying that. Again, though, Jon thinks that Edd's nickname is *perfect*, and that only makes sense if Bowen Marsh is ""red all over"", so to speak.

But why take my word for it when it so happens ASOIAF itself tells us that red skin makes a person a figurative ""pomegranate"" *when combined with red hair*.

###""With Your [Red] Hair… You Look Like A Pomegranate""
ASOIAF just so happens to make this point at the expense of none other than the redheaded Sansa Stark, *the quarry of Ser Shadrich,* the redheaded hedge knight I believe is actually Bowen Marsh's fellow crannogman Howland Reed:
&gt;Sansa smoothed down her skirts and sat. ""I think . . . fools, my lady? You mean . . . the sort in motley?""

&gt;""Feathers, in this case. What did you imagine I was speaking of? My son? Or these lovely ladies? **No, don't blush, *with your hair* it makes you look like a pomegranate.**"" (SOS San I)

Lest there be ambiguity that Sansa looking like a pomegranate is about her being a redhead, *Fire &amp; Blood* tells us that blushing Tullys turn ""red as their hair"":
&gt;…Lord Tully and his brother blustered and stammered and flushed red as their hair. (FB 574)

If Bowen Marsh is a redheaded crannogman, as the existence of this passage suggests he surely must be—even as ASOIAF clearly wants to avoid *openly* saying he is—then basic dramatic, narrative logic suggests that (a) the crannogman Howland Reed is almost certainly a redhead, too, and (b) that this information is of vital importance for deducing his identity.

##Howland Ain't ""Old""
As of AFFC/ADWD, Howland Reed is probably about 37 years old—old enough to show some mileage, but hardly an ""old man"", per se.

Consider: According to Meera's story of the Knight of the Laughing Tree, Howland traveled to the Isle of Faces to learn the magic of the green men ""when he had grown to manhood""—
&gt;""…one day **when he had grown to manhood** he decided he would leave the crannogs and visit the Isle of Faces."" (SOS B II)

—which for a male in ASOIAF means age sixteen. Howland was seemingly on the Isle of Faces for a whole winter—
&gt;""**All that winter the crannogman stayed on the isle**, but when the spring broke he heard the wide world calling and knew the time had come to leave."" (B II)

—and we know there were nearly two years of winter prior to the False Spring and the tourney at Harrenhal—
&gt;In the annals of Westeros, 281 AC is known as the Year of the False Spring. **Winter had held the land in its icy grip for close on two years,** but now at last the snows were melting, the woods were greening, the days were growing longer.

&gt;Though the white ravens had not yet flown, there were many even at the Citadel of Oldtown who believed that winter's end was nigh.

&gt;**As warm winds blew from the south, lords and knights from throughout the Seven Kingdoms made their way toward Harrenhal to compete in Lord Whent's great tournament** on the shore of the Gods Eye, which promised to be the largest and most magnificent competition since the time of Aegon the Unlikely. (TWOIAF)

—which Howland attended when he left the Isle of Faces:
&gt;""His skin boat was just where he'd left it, so he said his farewells and paddled off toward shore. He rowed and rowed, and finally saw the distant towers of a castle rising beside the lake. The towers reached ever higher as he neared shore, until he realized that this must be the greatest castle in all the world.""

&gt;""Harrenhal!"" Bran knew at once. ""It was Harrenhal!""

&gt;Meera smiled. ""Was it? … A great tourney was about to commence, and champions from all over the land had come to contest it."" (SOS B II)

Thus Howland was on the Isle of Faces for about two years. Even if Howland did not leave for the Isle of Faces as soon as he turned 16, and even if he was there for some months before the onset of winter, he was at most 19 during the Harrenhal Tourney, which took place late in 281 AC. Thus he is at most 38 years old in AFFC/ADWD (which take place in early-mid 300 AC) but probably more like 36-turning-37.

And lo! GRRM confirmed this in a Q&amp;A in 2002:
&gt;*How old is Howland Reed?*

&gt;He'd be in his thirties. (SSM *A Myriad of Questions* 3.27.02)

##""A Weary, Haunted Look About The Eyes""
After Jojen's trials north of the wall, Jojen's eyes pointedly reflect the strain he's been under:
&gt;Jojen's eyes were a dark green, the color of moss, but **heavy with a weariness** that Bran had never seen in them before. (DWD B I)
***
&gt;""The secrets of the old gods,"" said Jojen Reed. Food and fire and rest had helped restore him after the ordeals of their journey, but he seemed sadder now, sullen, with **a weary, haunted look about the eyes.** (DWD B II)

Given Bran's intuition that Howland resembles Jojen, it makes sense that Howland's face and eyes might similarly reflect his own hardships, right?

##Summary of Howland Reed's Possible/Probable Appearance
Thus far we can surmise that Howland Reed might very well look like an older, stronger version of the slender, very short Jojen. He's almost certainly about 37 years old. He'll likely have green eyes, and his visage may well reflect the hardships he's seen and lived through. We also have strong reason to believe that (a) Jojen's hair is *not* brown like Meera's and thus that Howland's isn't brown either, (b) that crannogmen are often redheads, and (c) that Howland Reed and Jojen are likely to be redheads, too.

#Ser Shadrich's Appearance: ""A Short, Wiry, Fox-Faced Man With Orange Hair""
How does Ser Shadrich's appearance comport with this picture of a short, slender yet strong, 37-ish, roadworn, ginger Howland Reed? Perfectly.

Brienne's POV describes Shadrich like this:
&gt;""Ser Shadrich was a wiry, fox-faced man with a sharp nose and a shock of orange hair, mounted on a rangy chestnut courser. …[H]e could not have been more than five foot two… (FFC B I)

""Alayne"" calls Shadrich…
&gt;…a short, wiry man with a wry smile, pointed nose, and bristly orange hair (FFC Ala II)

Later, ""Alayne"" describes Shadrich as…
&gt;…a short, sharp-faced man with a brush of orange hair…

…before expounding:
&gt;Ser Shadrich was so short that he might have been taken for a squire, but his face belonged to a much older man. She saw long leagues in the wrinkles at the corner of his mouth, old battles in the scar beneath his ear, and a hardness behind the eyes that no boy would ever have. This was a man grown. Even Randa overtopped him, though. (WOW Ala I)

##""Orange Hair""
Shadrich is first and foremost a ginger. His ""orange"" hair is noted in every description.

If it's said that ""orange"" hair is not the same as ""*red* hair"", and that Shadrich is thus not the redhead my earlier discussion suggested Howland Reed would be, ASOIAF disagrees. It explicitly stipulates that a ""red-headed"" man's hair might be termed ""orange"":
&gt;**[Melisandre's] hair was not the orange or strawberry color of common red-haired men**, but a deep burnished copper that shone in the light of the torches. (COK Pro)

We also meet a character named ""Ginger Jack"" who has an ""orange beard"". (DWD Dae VII)

##Shad's Unknown Eye Color
Shadrich and Jojen suspiciously form an interlocking set of imperfect knowledge: while Shadrich's orange hair is mentioned repeatedly, we are told nothing of his *eye* color, whereas we hear about Jojen's green eyes over and over, but we're told nothing of Jojen's *hair* color. Again, red hair (like Shadrich's) and green eyes (like Jojen's) go together like bangers and mash: it's the stereotypical coloration of earth's crannogmen, the Irish.

I suspect that in-world, ""it is known"" that crannogmen are redheads, just as we ""know"" Irishmen have red hair and green eyes. This helps justify our POVs' silence regarding Jojen's and Bowen Marsh's red hair: it isn't that remarkable, given that they're crannogmen. It also helps explain how the squires at Harrenhal pegged Howland Reed as a crannogman so easily (not withstanding his garb and spear).

##""Long Leagues"" &amp; ""A Hardness Behind The Eyes""
The ""long leagues in the wrinkles at the corner of [Shadrich's] mouth"" and the ""hardness behind [his] eyes"" make perfect sense if Shadrich is Howland Reed. Howland experienced war and death, and his son Jojen prominently manifests his own hardships in like fashion, developing a ""weary, haunted look about the eyes""—eyes which grow ""heavy with…weariness"". (DWD B III, I)

##Small, But They Seem ""Older""
There's a purely textual parallel here between Shadrich and Jojen which hints at the relationship between the two, in that both defy a certain expectation in such a way that they seem ""older"":
&gt;Ser Shadrich was so short that he might have been taken for a squire, but his face belonged to a much older man.

…while…
&gt;Jojen Reed was thirteen, only four years older than Bran. Jojen wasn't much bigger either, no more than two inches or maybe three, but he had a solemn way of talking that made him seem older and wiser than he really was. (SOS B I)

(I have to think the comparison of Shadrich to a squire winks Howland's at fracas with three squires at Harrenhal.)

##37 Years Old
Shadrich could easily be 37-ish. While he's clearly a veteran up-close, he's not yet an ""old man"" as such.

##""Five Foot Two"" &amp; ""Wiry""
Shadrich is ""five foot two"", but is twice called *""wiry""*. This is perfectly consistent with Shadrich being Howland, who is ""small like all crannogmen, but… strong as well"", and who Bran imagines looks like the very short, ""slender"" Jojen, ""only stronger"". ""Being slender yet strong"" happens to be the verbatim definition of ""wiry"" per Merriam-Webster.com's ""Definition of wiry for Students"". Collins' English Dictionary defines wiry similarly: ""Slender yet strong in constitution"" is exactly what we'd expect the father of Howland Reed's ""slender as swords"" children to be. (Note that Shadrich is also implicitly likened to thin metal by virtue of being wiry i.e. wire-y.)

##""Fox-Faced"" and Sly. Er... ""Wry.""
The fact that Brienne calls Shadrich *""fox-faced""* is a *huge* hint that he is Howland Reed, even though we're never told what Jojen looks like. How so?

Foxes are stereotypically (a) red-haired, like Shadrich and (b) *sly*. ""Sly as a fox"" is a timeworn cliche, with origins in the middle ages, when stories of Reynard, an anthropomorphic red fox and trickster figure—the sort to pull something like, say, The Knight of the Laughing Tree—proliferated. It just so happens that this cliche appears in the Brienne chapter following her meeting Shadrich, when she sees a ""sly red fox"" painted on some doors in Duskendale:
&gt;When Brienne peered more closely, she saw creatures in the foliage: **a sly red fox**, two sparrows on a branch, and behind those leaves the shadow of a boar. (FFC B II)

First of all, the doors confirm that foxes are considered sly in Westeros, too. Moreover, they're clearly symbolically loaded. I'll have more to say in the future about the painting, but here let's consider that the ""sly red fox"" might reference the fox-faced, red-haired Shadrich, who is never quite called ""sly"" but who clearly is (as I'll discuss shortly). Consider too that the night before Brienne meets Shadrich, who *calls himself a ""hunter""* and is literally *riding on the road,* she worries about both ""riders on the road"" and ""prowling foxes"":
&gt;Even in the black of night, there were **riders on the road**, and noises in the woods that might or might not have been owls and **prowling foxes**. So (FFC B I)

Note that ASOIAF explicitly aligns prowling with hunting in reference to wolves—
&gt;""They were runners, hunters, prowlers."" (COK B VI)

—which are closely related to foxes. (Both are canids.)

The sly/fox connection is made elsewhere, ""coincidentally"" in relation to a reclusive Stark bannerman, of all people:
&gt;**The Norrey looked like some old fox**—wrinkled and **slight of build**, but **sly-eyed** and spry. (DWD J XI)

This description of the Norrey as fox-ish and ""wrinkled"" is redolent of the ""fox-faced"" Ser Shadrich, who is much younger, yet still ""wrinkled"":
&gt;She saw long leagues in the wrinkles at the corner of [Shadrich's] mouth…

I believe that ASOIAF continuously ""rhymes"" with itself, reworking motifs and verbiage so as to suggest relationships or truths beyond those the story is telling us on the surface. In this case, there's a literal rhyme which adds to the figurative rhyme between the Norrey and Shadrich: the Norrey is ""sly-eyed and spry"", whereas Shadrich has a ""*wry*"" smi… le. This wordplay and the repeated motifs hint that Shadrich is ""like"" the Norrey in another, far more important respect: he also stands Lord Bannerman to the Starks of Winterfell.

The description of the Norrey also hints at *which* Stark bannerman Shadrich is. Who are the *only* other people the canon ever describes verbatim as *""slight of build""* like the foxy, oddly Shadrich-ish, ""slight of build"" Norrey? The children of *Howland Reed*:
&gt;Both Reeds were **slight of build**, slender as swords and scarcely taller than Bran himself. (COK B III)

Now, who in Westeros are singled out for being ""sly"", a la Brienne's ""sly red fox"" and the Shadrich-and-Reed-ish Norrey? *The crannogmen,* whom TWOIAF calls a *""small, sly people"".*

In a world where foxes are considered sly, might not the crannogmen be considered ""sly"" not (only?) because they *are*, but because *they are often fox-faced, like Shadrich?* Or perhaps foxes are considered sly in Westeros *because they look like the crannogmen*, who are ""known"" to be sly. (Such a phenomenon would echo the way in which the aforementioned earthly superstitions regarding red-haired people being of the devil in turn helped spawn the medieval belief that similarly-colored red *foxes* were devil-ish too.) Either idea is consistent with the fox-faced Ser Shadrich being merely the guise of the sly crannogman Howland Reed.

There's a further wink at the identity of the fox-faced Shadrich later in Brienne's journey, when she encounters a fox immediately before she meets a people who live ""amongst the *reeds*"":
&gt;Once **a fox crossed their path**, and set Meribald's dog to barking wildly.

&gt;And there were people too. **Some lived amongst the *reeds* in houses built of mud and straw**, whilst others fished the bay in **leather coracles** and built their **homes on rickety wooden stilts above the dunes.** (FFC B V)

""Reeds"" and ""mud"" instantly recalls Little Walder Frey calling Howland Reed's children ""mudmen"", (COK B III) not least because Brienne's reed-and-mud-people's ""homes on rickety wooden stilts"" sound so much like *crannogs*:
&gt;Here in Highland Perthshire the prehistoric crannogs were originally timber-built roundhouses **supported on piles or stilts driven into the loch bed.** (http://www.crannog.co.uk/what-is-a-crannog)

Indeed, the crannogmen just so happen to *also* be fishermen who live ""amongst the reeds"" in houses made of ""straw"":
&gt;[Bran] tried to recall all he had been taught of the crannogmen, who dwelt amongst the bogs of the Neck and seldom left their wetlands. They were a poor folk, **fishers** and frog-hunters who lived in **houses of thatch and woven reeds** on floating islands hidden in the deeps of the swamp. (COK B III)

Meanwhile, ""leather coracles"" are one-man boats *used by earthly crannogmen* (per en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crannog) which could easily be called ""skin boats""—leather is skin, after all—which is the term used to describe the boat used by… Howland Reed:
&gt;""So [Howland] donned a shirt sewn with bronze scales, like mine, took up a leathern shield and a three-pronged spear, like mine, and paddled **a little skin boat** down the Green Fork.""

The identity of Ser Shadrich, Brienne's ""sly red fox"", is practically spelled out for us, if we only know how to read between the lines.

##""Fox-Faced"" &amp; ""Sharp-Faced"". ""A Sharp Nose"". A ""Pointed Nose.""
We're never told anything about Jojen's face, so we don't know whether Jojen shares Shadrich's ""sharp"", ""pointed"" nose nor whether he is similarly ""sharp-faced""/""fox-faced"". But one intriguing character definitely does/is.

Tom O'Sevens has both ""foxy features"" and a ""long and sharp"" nose, very much like Shadrich's. (SOS A II; FFC Jai VII) Tom is called ""a small man"", recalling Howland being called ""small like all crannogmen"" and the crannogmen being called ""a small, sly [as a fox?] people"". (SOS Ary II) Tom is ""trim and slim"" with ""brown hair"", echoing Meera, who is ""slim as a boy, with long brown hair"". (SOS Epi; COK B III) Tom is said to be *""garbed""* in ""faded greens"" and leather—
&gt;…ragged green breeches and a frayed tunic of a lighter shade of green, with brown leather patches covering the holes. (FFC Jai VII)

—which reminds us of both a bedraggled version of Jojen's ""garb""—
&gt;All his garb was green, even to the leather of his boots… (COK B III)
***
&gt;Jojen Reed… dressed all in green… (SOS B I)

—and the ""green men"" of the Isle of Faces, whom Howland Reed visited and whose order he probably joined. (SOS Ary II, Ep, B II)

Tom hails from Sevenstreams, an area south of and fairly close to the Neck. From its first appearance in Chett's ASOS Prologue POV, Sevenstreams is next to and tightly textually associated with Hag's Mire:
&gt;She'd spread her legs for every boy in **Hag's Mire** so he'd figured why not him too? … When they caught [Chett] down near **Sevenstreams**, old Lord Walder Frey hadn't even bothered to come himself to do the judging.
***
&gt;""If we cannot cross the Blue Fork, we'll have to go around it, **through Sevenstreams and Hag's Mire.**"" (SOS C V)
***
&gt;All the way up the Blue Fork they rode, **past Sevenstreams where the river unraveled into a confusion of rills and brooks, then through Hag's Mire**, where glistening **green pools** waited to swallow the unwary… (ibid.)

""Green pools"" is verbatim how Jojen Reed's eyes are described—
&gt;When Jojen looked at Bran, his eyes were **green pools** full of sorrow. (COK B VI)

—while Sevenstreams and Hag's Mire collectively sound very much like the Neck. To wit, Chett of Hag's Mire was a ""leechman's son"". Perhaps he should have moved north a bit, since Arya tells us…
&gt;""There's leeches in the Neck as big as pigs."" (COK A X)

Hag's Mire's ""pools wait[ing] to swallow the unwary"" and Sevenstreams' ""*confusion* of rills and brooks"" combine to recall Jason Mallister's description of Howland Reed's eminently confusing, deadfall-riddled domain:
&gt;""A dozen streams drain the wetwood, all shallow, silty, and uncharted. I would not even call them rivers. The channels are ever drifting and changing.  There are endless sandbars, deadfalls, and tangles of rotting trees. And Greywater Watch moves. "" (SOS C V)

Given that Sevenstreams is not far at all from the Neck, it *could* make in-world genetic sense for a man from Sevenstreams to look something like Shadrich if Shadrich is indeed Howland Reed. However, I suspect most of the foregoing is less about the similar gene pools of Sevenstreams and the Neck than it is about Tom being a kind of metatextual signpost. By using the sharp-nosed, foxy-featured, slim, brown-haired, green-and-leather garbed small man Tom O'Sevens to evoke both the sharp-nosed, fox-faced Ser Shadrich *and* the Reeds (small Howland of the Green Men, green-and-leather garbed Jojen, *and* slim brown-haired Meera) while also rhyming Tom's home of Sevenstreams (and thus its neighbor Hag's Mire) with the Neck, ASOIAF whispers that Ser Shadrich is none other than the Lord of the Neck, Howland Reed.

Something Tom says to Merrett Frey further invites us to connect Tom to the mysterious Shadrich (and thus to connect Shadrich with the Reeds via the Reed-referencing Tom):
&gt;""I sang at your daughter's wedding. And passing well, I thought. **That Pate she married was a cousin. We're all cousins in Sevenstreams. Didn't stop him from turning niggard when it was time to pay me.**"" (SOS Ep)

Tom's complaint about his employer ""turning niggard"" *blatantly* parallels the lament of Ser Shadrich regarding *his* employer Hibald:
&gt;[Brienne:] ""I thought you were in this merchant's hire.""

&gt;""Only so far as Duskendale. **Hibald is as niggardly as he is fearful. And he is very fearful.**"" (FFC B I)

Two small, fox-faced, sharp-nosed men complaining about their employers being niggardly is no coincidence. Meanwhile Tom's concurrent remark that the people of his Neck-like home are ""all cousins"" implies they are insular and is likely just as true of Howland Reed's people, who we're told ""prefer… to keep to themselves."" (AWOIAF) Again, the point of GRRM's artifice here is to have Tom remind us simultaneously of both Shadrich and the Reeds, thereby foreshadowing the revelation that Shadrich is Howland Reed himself.

##""Chestnut Courser""
Shadrich rides a ""rangy chestnut courser"" that happens to be a verbatim match for the last horse Sansa rode in King's Landing: a ""chestnut courser"". (ACOK Tyrion IX) Given that Shadrich mentions Varys, might he have obtained Sansa's horse from the eunuch? Regardless, the symbolism of Shadrich bringing Sansa her horse (even if only one that's textually identical to it) is *right there*: Shadrich/Howland is going to help Sansa escape.

It's also worth noting that chestnuts are called ""reds"". They're the gingers of horses. Like horse, like rider, right? ASOIAF calls out another occasion when this happens (with a ""red"")—
&gt;Ser Addam Marbrand… made a gallant show of it, riding **a spirited red courser whose mane was the same copper color as the long hair that streamed past Ser Addam's shoulders.** (COK Ar VIII)

—which so happens to involve someone who is, like Shadrich's horse, ""rangy"":
&gt;Ser Addam dropped to one knee, **a rangy man** with dark copper hair that fell to his shoulders… (GOT Ty VIII)

Why point this out? Ser Addam is cousin to and searches for the missing Tyrek Lannister, who [I've argued elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/63masy/spoilers_extended_littlefingers_third_knight_ser/) we are given every reason in the world to believe is Shadrich's companion in the Vale, Ser Byron the Beautiful (but who I have stated is not, in the end, Ser Byron). Once again, ASOIAF rhymes with itself, carefully arranging motifs in its narrative surface to hint at a deeper story.

",1,(Spoilers Extended) Fire and Blood Easter Egg,591,45
0,1,0,84,15,"How would you go about invading the North successfully?

Here are my ideas.

**Don't Declare Independence** Balon should have learned his lesson after the Greyjoy Rebellion. Even if the ultimate goal of the ironborn is to break apart the Seven Kingdoms and be independent, doing so at the outset of a war, which for all you know could be quickly resolved, is a bad idea. Becoming king makes you a target, staying a lord makes you an ally that different sides will try to court. Instead of trying to revive the Old Way, Balon's initial goals should have been to win land through supporting a side, as the Reader proposed.

&gt;""It's land we need, not crowns. With Stannis Baratheon and Tywin Lannister contending for the Iron Throne, we have a rare chance to improve our lot. Let us take one side or the other, help them to victory with our fleets, and claim the lands we need from a grateful king

**Ally With The Lannisters** Allying with Robb was a bad idea. Balon was right to reject his offer. The ironborn have less chance of holding the Westerlands than the North, and whatever plunder they stole would eventually be paid back in blood. Instead, ally with who is an enemy of the North, where the lands you want to take are. That would be the Lannisters. The Lannisters lack a fleet and gain the most from you attacking the North, unlike Stannis and Renly. Because of that, the ironborn are in a better position to make a deal. Have Victarion promised a position as master of ships and arranged to marry Cersei. Perhaps Theon could be betrothed to Myrcella, although that is unlikely.  Also get a promise from the king to give you whatever land you conquer. Conquering the entire North is ridiculous, and I don't think Tywin would have allowed it. But taking chunks of the western coast is possible.

**Rally The Ironborn** I made a count and only 120 ships that were used in attacking the North. The Iron Fleet had 100, Asha 12, and Theon 8. Yet we know that the Ironborn can man about 1,000 longships. Maybe he had a second wave prepared that was ruined by Theon taking Winterfell or Balon's death, or maybe it took months for ships to return from the Stepstones and elsewhere, but that still seems foolish to me. Balon had a chance to take the northmen unawares, he should have used as many men available in attacking the north.

**Surprise Attacks** The first attacks should be against the most important targets. In the books, Balon did the opposite, sending Theon and Asha to make diversionary attacks in the northwest while Victarion captured Moat Cailin. Instead, the first attacks should have been against Flint's Finger and soft targets like Barrowton, and smaller attacks launched to weaken the northern counterattack.

**Capture ""Islands""** The goal of these attacks should be to conquer defensible points that can be used to launch raids. The best choice is the ""Flint Peninsula"" (Flint's Finger, Cape Kraken, and the Flint Cliffs). This is close to the Iron Islands and its only land border is the Neck. Bear Island is also a good target for raiding the northwest. There appears to be a small island near the Stony Shore that could be captured as well. Even with permission from the crown, trying to conquer and hold areas that border the North by land is untenable.

**Use Theon Effectively** Balon didn't trust Theon, but he should have used his knowledge of the North. Sending him to advise or jointly command an attack on Barrowton, Flint's Finger, or Bear Island would have put him to better use than making pointless attacks on the Stony Shore.

This is dumb, and it's been done a thousand time before. Plus I don't really know what I'm talking about. Maybe it relies too much on hindsight. But I'm bored, so there you go, another armchair general's thoughts. What do you think Balon should have done?

**Edit**
From everyone's comments it seems the best option would be to declare for Stannis and see what happens. Stannis is the weakest claimant, which means the war will be long, giving you the opportunity to raid and pillage as long as possible. Also, he's the only claimant without lands on the west coast, which means you can attack whichever kingdom seems best at the time. 

Since Stannis' survival is uncertain at the beginning of the war (depending on when Balon joins in, by the time he crowned himself in the real timeline Renly was already dead), it'd be best to attack the Westerlands first to not anger Renly or the Starks. If Stannis wins you can then attack the Reach or the North and Riverlands (a better option, since they have less men and lack fleets) for Stannis. If Stannis loses you can ally with the North or the Reach and use that alliance to get land. In this situation, if against all odds the Lannisters won you'd have to give up gold and hostages.",1,(Spoilers Extended) Imagine You Are Balon Greyjoy...,4803,52

#Appendix One: Howland = Ser Shadrich: *The Mystery Knight* Parallel
There are an incredible number of parallels between ASOIAF's Vale subplot—in which three hitherto unknown hedge knights (Sers Shadrich of the Shady Glen, Morgarth the Merry, and Byron the Beautiful) are poised to attend a rigged tourney being held by a former Master of Coin in the shadow of his white castle for the ulterior purpose of arranging a wedding with treasonous implications—and *The Mystery Knight*, in which three hitherto unknown hedge knights (Sers Glendon Ball, Maynard Plumm aka Bloodraven, Ser Kyle The Cat) attend a rigged wedding tourney being held by a former Master of Coin at his white castle for the ulterior purpose of starting a rebellion.

The finale of my series on Tyrek Lannister will contain an extensive discussion of said parallels. Here, I wish only to point out that Shadrich being Howland Reed creates a number of delicious parallels between him and the three hedge knights of the Mystery Knight that don't exist if Shadrich is just Shadrich. Given my belief that GRRM deliberately contrives to make our story ""rhyme"" with itself and especially with its invented ""history"", I find this unsurprising, fascinating, and revelatory.

##Name Games
The three hedge knights from *The Mystery Knight* are introduced as follows:
&gt;""I am Ser Kyle, the Cat of Misty Moor. Under yonder chestnut sits Ser Glendon, ah, Ball. And here you have the good Ser Maynard Plumm."" (tMK)

The epithets ""Glendon Ball"" and ""the Cat of the Misty Moor"" clearly riff on ""Howland Reed, the Mad Mouse of the Shady Glen"".

""Glendon"" blatantly recalls ""the Shady *Glen*"". The rhyme between the monikers ""The Cat of the Misty Moor"" and the ""the Mad Mouse of Shady Glen"" is beyond blatant.

The names ""Glendon Ball"" and ""Howland Reed"" follow the same pattern:

- Both last names are common, one-syllable nouns with a double-letter: Ball, Reed.

- One first name contains ""lend"", the other ""land"".
- Both first names begin with a four-letter one syllable noun: Glen and Howl.

##Howland and Glendon Parallels
Parallels between Howland/Shadrich and the three knights go far beyond these name games. We meet Ball as he sits under a ""chestnut"" tree. We meet Shadrich astride a ""chestnut courser.""

Ball is called ""The Bastard of the Pussywillows."" Pussywillows and Reeds go hand in hand—reeds and willows are paired throughout ASOIAF. (SOS A II, FFC tIC, B VIII, DWD Tyr III)

Dunk's thoughts about Ball—
&gt;And he was young. Sixteen, might be. No more than eighteen. **Dunk might have taken him for a squire if Ser Kyle had not named him with a Ser.** (tMK)

—""rhyme"" with Sansa's thoughts about Shadrich:
&gt;Ser Shadrich was so short that **he might have been taken for a squire, but his face belonged to a much older man.** (WOW Ala I)

Similarly, Ball's hair is dark brown, whereas everybody expects Fireball's son to have red hair, while Shadrich has red hair, whereas most readers assume Howland Reed has brown hair like Meera.

##Two Tricksters: Shadrich/Howland &amp; Ser Maynard Plumm/Bloodraven
Plumm is introduced as ""*the good* Ser Maynard Plumm"". Hibald twice refers to ""*good* Ser Shadrich"". (FFC B VI)

Maynard Plumm does not ""chance the lists."" Nor will Shadrich, who tells Randa and Sansa that he will not joust. (WOW Ala)

Shadrich looking ""much older"" than Sansa expects and showing ""wrinkles"" and ""a hardness behind the eyes"" parallels the unglamored Bloodraven, who is ""older than Dunk remembered… with a lined hard face"". (tMK)

The name ""Maynard"" is redolent of ""Reynard"", the name of [the red fox trickster of medieval legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynard) I earlier mentioned in relation to the fox-faced Shadrich. Reynard is a figure GRRM knows all about, given that ""Reynard Reyne"" has a ""sly tongue"" and is ""charming and cunning"". (Westerlands; TWOIAF) Maynard is a trickster figure, and so is red-headed, foxy ""Shadrich"", assuming I'm right that Shadrich is Howland. 

Bloodraven is of course intimately associated with the weirwoods to which Shadrich's red-eyed white sigil alludes. (Dunk meets ""Maynard"", Kyle and Ball ""amongst the weirwood stumps"", a phrase which by the way recalls the ""amongst the reeds"" line from Brienne's story I connected to Shadrich earlier.)

Finally, Bloodraven is apparently a magic-user of some power, as he's glamored himself as Plumm. If *anyone* in ASOIAF is a magic-user of some power, it's *Howland Reed*, who ""learned all the magics of my people"", but ""wanted more"", leading him to visit the Isle of Faces and the green men, of whom it's said:
&gt;All the tales agreed that the green men had strange magic powers. (SOS B II)

The parallel is thus far better if ""Shadrich"" is Howland Reed and thus a comparable magician to Bloodraven.

##Shadrich and Kyle the Cat of Misty Moor
Both Shadrich and Kyle speak of themselves as being their sigil animals:
&gt;""Your common mouse will run from blood and battle. The mad mouse seeks them out."" (FFC B I)
***
&gt;Ser Kyle smiled a silken smile. ""The cat who wants his bowl of cream must know when to purr and when to show his claws, Ser Duncan. ""

Both Kyle and Shadrich are gingers: Ser Kyle has ""flamboyant ginger whiskers""; Shadrich has ""bristly orange hair""/""a shock of orange hair"". There may be some word play here, too. Whiskers are usually bristly, and flamboyance can ""shock"" staid sensibilities. (FFC Ala II, B I; TMK)

""The Misty Moor"" sounds very much like a description of the Neck. I suspect Kyle is as he is in part to hint that the ginger knight Shadrich might be from *a* misty moor of sorts, because he is Howland Reed.

#Appendix Two: Howland Reed and the Bones of Ned Stark
What follows assumes you agree that Ser Shadrich is indeed Lord Howland Reed of Greywater Watch.

Given that Shadrich rides a horse like Sansa's and tells Brienne he is looking for Sansa, and given that his interactions with ""Alayne"" are sly and knowing and see him catch her when she is falling, it seems likely he is endeavoring to protect the daughter of his liege lord and friend, Ned Stark. But what, exactly, is Howland doing when Brienne first meets him on the road to Duskendale, when he's supposedly escorting a merchant named Hibald, his six ""serving men"", and their wagon?
&gt;Three hours later [Brienne and company] came up upon another party struggling toward Duskendale; a merchant and his serving men, accompanied by yet another hedge knight. The merchant rode a dappled **grey mare**, whilst his servants took turns pulling his wagon. Four labored in the traces as the other two walked beside the wheels, but when they heard the sound of horses they formed up around the wagon with quarterstaffs of ash at the ready. The merchant produced a crossbow, the knight a blade. ""You will forgive me if I am suspicious,"" called the merchant, ""but the times are troubled, and I have only good Ser Shadrich to defend me. Who are you?"" (FFC B I)

##A Portentous Niggardly Merchant on a Grey Mare
In-world, Hibald and his men may be what the seem. Hibald's ""grey mare"" is a textual match for the ""grey mare"" of the merchant from ACOK Arya II, who like Hibald—
&gt;""Hibald is as niggardly as he is fearful. And he is very fearful.""

—is a cheapskate:
&gt;The next morning, a sleek merchant on **a grey mare** reined up by Yoren and offered to buy his wagons and everything in them for a quarter of their worth.

Hibald may thus be unaware that Ser Shadrich is Howland Reed. But even if *in-world* Hibald is ""no one, truly,"" so to speak, the name ""Hibald"" is a metatextual hint to readers that his escort ""Ser Shadrich"" is in fact transporting the bones of Ned Stark—which he intercepted at Greywater Watch after Catelyn sent them north in ACOK—to the Quiet Isle. How so?

##History Class!!
In order to explain how the name ""Hibald"" could possibly connote that Shadrich is moving Ned Stark's bones in AFFC Brienne I, we need to talk about the real-world history of Great Britain during the so-called Heptarchy or *Seven Kingdoms* period, specifically as regards an Anglo-Saxon King of the North named Oswald and a saintly monk named (you guessed it) *Hibald.*

(Sources for what follows include: wikipedia entries for Heptarchy, Kingdom of Northumbria, Humber, Kingdom of Lindsey, The Fens, Isle of Axholme, Oswald of Northumbria, Osthryth, Oswy, Osric of Deira, Oswine of Deira, Æthelred, Bardney Abbey, and Hibald; St. Bede's [*Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation*](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_History_of_the_English_Nation_(Jane), [bardneyparishchurches.org.uk](https://web.archive.org/web/20130430231556/http://bardneyparishchurches.org.uk/)  and [lincsheritage.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20110716023641/http://www.lincsheritage.org/community_heritage/guides_information/treasure_trove/article.php?id=24).)

##The Seven Kingdoms (of Anglo-Saxon Great Britain)
In the 7th century, much of the island of Great Britain was divided into something that will sound very familiar to readers of ASOIAF: ""seven kingdoms"" ruled by seven kings, an arrangement later historians dubbed the Heptarchy. These seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms (as well as other, smaller petty kingdoms and sub-kingdoms) later consolidated into the kingdom of England, much as the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were consolidated under Targaryen rule.

##Northumbria: ""The North"" of the Heptarchy
One of the seven kingdoms of the Heptarchy was Northumbria (itself forged c. 604 from the kingdoms Deira and Bernicia). Northumbria was, as the name implies, the northernmost kingdom in Anglo-Saxon Great Britain, just as ""The North"" was the northernmost of Westeros's Seven Kingdoms. Northumbria was also home to Hadrian's Wall, which GRRM acknowledges inspired the Wall of Westeros.

##The Humber: The ""Saltspear"" of the Heptarchy
The name Northumbria came from the Anglo-Saxon for ""the people north of the Humber"". Technically a tidal estuary, the Humber is in effect a long inlet off the North Sea, easily navigable by deep-sea vessels, much like the Saltspear is a long inlet off the Sunset Sea navigable by ironborn longships. During the Heptarchy, the Humber was seen as forming the natural boundary between Northumbria and the southern kingdoms, much as the Saltspear helps define the North proper in ASOIAF.

##Lindsey: ""The Neck"" of the Heptarchy
On the southern coast/bank of the Humber, across from Northumbria, lay the petty kingdom of Lindsey. Like ""the Neck"" of Westeros, much of Lindsey was marshland and/or prone to flooding. Part of Lindsey lay in what is today known as ""The Fens"", a now-drained but ""naturally marshy"" region of England. (Recall that ""Fenn"" is the name of a noble house of the Neck.) In one particularly marshy area of Lindsey, towns and villages were built on ""areas of dry, raised ground"" surrounded by swamp, which sounds a lot like giant crannogs.

Consider this passage from an 1891 writing extolling the progress that had been made draining the ""fever-haunted marshes"" of Lincolnshire, the site of medieval Lindsey:
&gt;I FANCY that many people still picture Lincolnshire to themselves as **a region of bogs and swamps, of fever-haunted marshes, and plague-infested lowlands.** …

&gt;…[But now] **In the parts of Lindsey**, there are no fens, their place being taken by the Cars, which were **once wide swamps**, bordering the course of a small stream or river. ([M.C. Balfour's *Legends of the Cars*](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0015587X.1891.9720054))

Balfour's implicit ""before"" picture of Lincolnshire and Lindsey sounds exactly like The Neck, with its ""Fever River"", bogs, swamps and wetlands.

On medieval Lindsey's northern border lay an important monastery called ""Barrow."" Lo and behold, on the Neck's northern border lies the ""barrowlands"", whose men are both (a) textually associated with the crannogmen of the Lindsey-ish Neck—
&gt;Others are waiting to join him all along the kingsroad, **barrow knights and crannogmen**… (GOT B VI)

—and, evidently and unusually for the North, (b) knights. Knights take holy vows, just as the monks of Barrow surely did.

Affirming the clear sense that there's an intentional analogy between the Neck and Lindsey (and hence between the North and Northumbria) is the fact that by the time Deira and Bernicia were combined to form Northumbria, the ""kingdom"" of Lindsey had long been subjugated and quasi-absorbed by Deira, thus prefiguring the subjugation of the Marsh Kings by Winterfell and the absorption of the Neck into the *political* North, despite the fact that the lands of the crannogmen are largely *south* of Moat Cailin, the Fever River, and the Saltspear, just as Deira-and-later-Northumbria-ruled Lindsey was south of the Humber.

##King Oswald of Northumbria, the Whiteblade
King (later Saint) Oswald ruled Northumbria from 634 to 642, turning it into the most powerful of the seven kingdoms in Great Britain. Oswald was known as ""Whiteblade"", which recalls the *original* version of the Starks' heirloom sword, Ice, which predated the existence of Valyrian steel by centuries and was thus surely a literal white blade, like the Dayne's ""white sword"", Dawn. (SOS Jai VIII)

##Bishop Aidan: the Septon Meribald of the Heptarchy
King Oswald was a Christian convert, and he used his power to convert the pagan people of his realm to Christianity. The first bishop brought in by Oswald to effect this policy was an ""austere"" man who took a ""severe"" approach to spreading the word of god—which sounds much like the current High Sparrow. His harsh approach failed.

He was replaced by Bishop Aidan, who sounds *a lot* like Septon Meribald. Aidan…
&gt;…travelled ceaselessly throughout the countryside, spreading the gospel to both the Anglo-Saxon nobility and to the socially disenfranchised (including children and slaves). (wikipedia: Aidan of Lindisfarne)

Like Meribald, Aidan gave the people ""first the milk of gentle doctrine"", easily digested—here, think of Meribald speaking to Pod of ""the cobbler""—and he…
&gt;…delighted in distributing immediately among the poor whatsoever was given him by the kings or rich men of the world. He was wont to traverse both town and country on foot, never on horseback… (St. Bede)

Again, this sounds *exactly* like Meribald happily giving away his beloved oranges, feeding ""two morsels to Dog for every one he ate himself,"" and walking until his feet turned hard as horn. (FFC B VII)

##Lindisfarne/Holy Island: the ""Quiet Isle"" of the Heptarchy
And where did King Oswald establish Bishop Aidan's seat? On the island of Lindisfarne…
&gt;…also **known simply as Holy Island, …a tidal island** off the northeast coast of England… (wikipedia)

""Holy Island"" is the obvious inspiration for the Quiet Isle of Westeros. Just as Quiet Isle is a tidal island that can only be accessed by carefully following the ""path of faith"" across the ""mudflats"", (FFC B VI) so is Holy Island…
&gt;…accessible, most times, at low tide by crossing sand and mudflats which are covered with water at high tides. These sand and mud flats carry an ancient pilgrims' path…

&gt;Warning signs urge visitors walking to the island to keep to the marked path, check tide times and weather carefully and to seek local advice if in doubt. (wikipedia)

The similarities don't end there. Both islands are famous for their mead—
&gt;St Aidan's Winery is the home of the **world famous Lindisfarne Mead**. Lindisfarne Mead is a unique alcoholic fortified wine manufactured here on the Holy Island of Lindisfarne. (http://www.lindisfarne-mead.co.uk/)
***
&gt;""…**our mead and cider are far famed.** - Brother Narbert of Quiet Isle (FFC B VI)

—and for healing: Holy Island was also known as Medcaut, a name derived from the Latin for ""healing"", and St. Aidan's successor there, St. Cuthbert, was a renowned healer dubbed ""the wonder worker of Britain"", recalling the Quiet Isle's Elder Brother:
&gt;""The Seven have blessed our Elder Brother with healing hands. He has restored many a man to health that even the maesters could not cure, and many a woman too."" (FFC B VI)

##Two Kings of the North's Heads Impaled and Displayed
Having provided for the establishment of the Quiet Isle-inspiring monastery on Holy Island and the popularization of Christianity, King Oswald of Northumbria—Great Britain's King of the North—was killed by the pagan King Penda of neighboring Mercia—the largest/most powerful of the southern kingdoms of Great Britain—in 642.

King Penda had King Oswald beheaded, impaled Oswald's head on a stake and put it on display—much as King Joffrey has (would-be King of the North) Ned Stark's head cut off, ""impaled"" on a ""spike"", and displayed above the Red Keep. (GOT S VI)

##The Bones of Two Beheaded Northern Kings
Oswald became a saint after his death. Both recorded history and popular folklore tell an interesting story about what befell his bones that I believe GRRM is very clearly riffing on in ASOIAF—one which ultimately suggests that some if not all of Ned Stark's remains have not made it through the Neck, but are instead being taken by ""Ser Shadrich"" to the Quiet Isle when we first meet Shadrich in AFFC Brienne I.

In 675 or 679, Oswald's niece Queen Osthyrth decided to move some of Oswald's holy bones via wagon to an abbey in Bardney, which was located in the swampy, Neck-like kingdom of Lindsey. When the wagon bearing Oswald's bones arrived at Bardney Abbey one evening, the monks there famously *refused to open their closed doors* to it due to lingering resentment over Oswald—a ""foreign king"" of Northumbria—having exercised dominion over their ""kingdom"" of Lindsey.

Now, keeping in mind that Ned and Oswald seem to be mirroring one another in death, notice the metaphor GRRM uses when he foregrounds the question of ""where Ned had come to rest"":
&gt;It made [Catelyn] wonder where Ned had come to rest. The silent sisters had taken his bones north, escorted by Hallis Mollen and a small honor guard. Had Ned ever reached Winterfell, to be interred beside his brother Brandon in the dark crypts beneath the castle? **Or did the door slam shut** at Moat Cailin before Hal and the sisters could pass? (SOS C V)

Catelyn fears Ned's bones ran into *a closed door* in the Neck. Just like the famously (see below) closed doors at Bardney in Lindsey.

The motifs of the real-world legend are unmistakably reworked in ASOIAF. In legend it was the men of a holy order located in swampy Neck-like Lindsey who literally closed their literal doors to Oswald's bones because Oswald had ""reigned over them as a foreign king"". In ASOIAF it is the women of a holy order who were moving Ned's bones when the *figurative* door to the North—Moat Cailin, located in the swampy, Lindsey-like Neck—was *figuratively* slammed shut by the forces of a ""foreign king"": Balon's ironmen.

Given the parallels—and the fact that Catelyn foregrounds the question of ""*where* Ned had come to rest""—I am certain that the answer to Catelyn's last question is ""Yes."" 

##A Heavenly Light and Always Opened Doors
Here's the thing: the doors of Bardney Abbey didn't stay closed for long. Later that night, the monks of Bardney Abbey saw a bright pillar of light ""reaching from the wagon up to heaven"". They saw this as a miracle and threw open their doors, welcoming Oswald's bones after all. Over them they placed ""his banner made of gold and purple""—recalling the disposition of Ned's bones at Riverrun:
&gt;They had laid [Ned] out on a trestle table and covered him with a banner, the white banner of House Stark with its grey direwolf sigil. (COK C V)

The monks vowed to henceforth always leave their doors open—some sources say they went so far as to remove their gate or doors.
&gt;This led to the saying that the doors were never locked in Bardney… ([link](https://web.archive.org/web/20130430231556/http://bardneyparishchurches.org.uk/))

…and…

&gt;Even today, if you leave a door open, in Lincolnshire, you might be asked ""Do you come from Bardney?"" ([Bardney Village History](https://community.lincolnshire.gov.uk/bardneyvillagehistory/section.asp?docId=82156))

Today, there's a coffee shop in Bardney called ""The Open Door"".

GRRM salutes this bit of folklore in ASOIAF not just by having Catelyn ask ""did the door slam shut at Moat Cailin"", but also by having St. Oswald-analogue Ned Stark say:
&gt;""**My door is always open** to the Night's Watch,"" Father said.

(That is the *only* instance of anyone saying anything about always leaving a door open in the canon.)

Wait! Does the fact that Oswald's bones passed through the door after all mean that Ned's bones have made it past Moat Cailin? No ma'am. I've omitted two crucial pieces of history which suggest that as ""Ser Shadrich"", Howland Reed escorts Ned's remains to the Quiet Isle.

##Oswald's Skull &amp; The Holy Isle
First, Queen Osthryth didn't move *all* of St. Oswald's remains to Bardney Abbey. Per St. Bede, Oswald's brother King Oswy ""buried [Oswald's] head in the church of Lindisfarne""—that is, *at the monastery on Holy Island, Great Britain's version of Westeros's Quiet Isle.* Quiet Isle is, of course, home to an ostentatiously foregrounded graveyard and gravedigger.

If the decapitated, formerly impaled and displayed head of the King of Northumbria was buried on ""Holy Island"", a tidal island famed for mead and healing, might not Howland Reed move the remains of the decapitated, formerly impaled and displayed head of the (theoretical) King of the North Ned Stark to Quiet Isle, a tidal island famed for mead and healing (whether with or without Ned's other remains)?

(As to why Ned's skull might be important, there are many reasons to believe skulls are used to create psychic networks in ASOIAF: see the golden skulls of the Golden Company and the Whispers.) 

##Saint Hibald and King-Saint Oswald's Bones
Second, GRRM decided to name the merchant escorted by Ser Shadrich ""Hibald"". A *Saint* Hibald was the abbot of Bardney Abbey—the very Abbey which closed, then opened its doors to Oswald's bones c. 675/9. St. Hibald was active between 664 and 690. Logically, then St. Hibald was involved with the disposition of King Oswald's bones.

If you doubt GRRM named Shadrich's merchant after St. Hibald, consider that Shadrich describes Hibald using exactly two words—""niggardly"" and ""fearful""—whereas St. Bede described St. Hibald using exactly two words: ""continent"" and ""holy"". ""Niggardly"" and ""continent"" are both synonyms for abstemious, while a ""holy"" man is a god*fearing* man.

Consider this, too: When ASOIAF's Hibald parks his wagon outside an inn for the night, the verbiage reads like a definite wink to the legend of the heavenly light that shone when Oswald's wagon was left outside for the night at Bardney Abbey, complete with a coy reference to the fanfare of divine trumpets: 
&gt;Hibald was for stopping too, and bid his men to **leave the wagon near the stables. Warm yellow light shone** through the diamond-shaped panes of the inn's windows, and Brienne heard a stallion **trumpet** at the scent of her mare. (FFC B I)

In sum, by naming Shadrich's merchant after St. Hibald, GRRM hints at the presence of the bones of St. Oswald-analogue Ned Stark. Based on their location, direction of travel, and the fact that Oswald's skull went to Lindisfarne, I'm convinced that Shadrich aka Howland Reed is at minimum taking Ned's skull to the Quiet Isle. (Once there, he joins forces with Elder Brother aka ""Ser Morgarth"". Together they take ship for the Vale to seek service with Littlefinger, father of Alayne Stone.)

##""Serving Men""
There are several more hints that Shadrich is moving Ned's remains hidden in the description of Hibald, his men, and his wagon.

Brienne refers to Hibald's six ""serving men"". We repeatedly see ""serving men"" involved with moving corpses:
&gt;When they found a body [the kindly man] would say a prayer and make certain life had fled, and Arya would fetch **the serving men, whose task it was to carry the dead down to the vaults.** (FFC Ary II)
***
&gt;Two serving men were carrying off the dead dog's carcass… (DWD R III)
***
&gt;When the serving men arrived to bear the corpse away, the blind girl followed them. (DWD tBG)

Whether Hibald's ""serving men"" are doing the same or are merely there as a textual nod to the fact that Shadrich is doing so, I'm not sure.

##""Quarterstaffs Of Ash""
Hibald's serving men wield ""quarterstaffs of ash"". The fact that the quarterstaffs are ash is a clue that Ned's bones are present, as ash is the wood used by Hallis Mollen—*the very man Catelyn charges with escorting Ned's bones*—to fly House Stark's standard:
&gt;Hallis Mollen went before them through the gate, carrying the rippling white **banner of House Stark atop a high standard of grey ash.** (GOT B VI)

The term ""quarterstaff"" is only used a handful of other times in the canon. All but once it refers to Septon Meribald's quarterstaff. Meribald (who, remember, is so very akin to Bishop Aiden of England's Quiet Isle-esque Holy Island) uses his quarterstaff to probe the ""path of faith"" that approaches the Quiet Isle, where I believe Shadrich is taking Ned's remains when we first meet him:
&gt;The path of faith was a crooked one, Brienne could not help but note. Though the island seemed to rise to the northeast of where they left the shore, Septon Meribald did not make directly for it. Instead, he started due east, toward the deeper waters of the bay, which shimmered blue and silver in the distance. The soft brown mud squished up between his toes. **As he walked he paused from time to time, to probe ahead with his quarterstaff.** (FFC B VI)

The only other ""quarterstaffs"" in our story are wielded by ""novice septons"" in a passage that also mentions Ser Osfryd (brother to Osmund, who is sometimes referred to ""by mistake"" as ""Oswald"", a la King/Saint Oswald) and the bones the sparrows had piled outside the Sept of Baelor—the very same ""bones of holy men"" Brienne had passed on the road *just* before she meets Shadrich and Hibald:
&gt;They descended from the litter under Blessed Baelor's statue. The queen was pleased to see that **the bones** and filth had been cleaned away. **Ser Osfryd** had told it true; the crowd was neither as numerous nor as unruly as the sparrows had been. They stood about in small clumps, gazing sullenly at the doors of the Great Sept, where **a line of novice septons had been drawn up with quarterstaffs in their hands.** (FFC C X)

The way Hibald's ""serving men"" respond to Brienne's approach—
&gt;…when [the serving men] heard the sound of horses they formed up around the wagon with quarterstaffs of ash at the ready. 

—recalls the ""small honor guard"" that was to accompany Ned's bones. Thus whether the ""serving men"" know about Howland and/or Ned's bones and/or are actually guards, symbolically they help convey what ""Shadrich"" is up to in this scene.

##A Wagon and a Wain
We see Hibald's men ""laboring in the traces"" of their wagon mere pages after we see the future High Sparrow and other pilgrims verbatim ""in the traces"" of a ""wayn"" (i.e. a wagon) piled high with bones which sound an awful lot like saint's bones, a la St. Osmund's:
&gt;""These are the bones of holy men, murdered for their faith. They served the Seven even unto death. Some starved, some were tortured. Septs have been despoiled, maidens and mothers raped by godless men and demon worshipers. Even silent sisters have been molested. Our Mother Above cries out in her anguish. It is time for all anointed knights to forsake their worldly masters and defend our Holy Faith. Come with us to the city, if you love the Seven.""

Notice that the future High Septon is recruiting, but Brienne isn't moved to join him, whereas she's happy to travel with Meribald, recalling King/Saint Oswald's first, ""severe"" but unsuccessful bishop. GRRM's little joke is that while a wagon heads one way, openly piled high with holy bones and surrounded by righteous holy folk, the bones of St. Oswald-analogue Ned Stark are on a wagon headed the other way, right under our noses, in the company of a ""hedge knight"", a merchant and some servants.

##Connected By Wire?
I do wonder whether the text's insistent association of Shadrich with wire—
&gt;Ser Shadrich was a **wiry**, fox-faced man… (FFC B I)
***
&gt;""I would do the same if she were my daughter,"" said the last knight, **a short, wiry man** with a wry smile, pointed nose, and bristly orange hair. (Ala II)

—might not be winking at his transportation of Ned's skull, given that the only time we ""see"" it we're told it is attached to his other bones ""with fine silver wire"". (COK C V) (To be clear, ""wiry"" literally means wire-y. That is the actual etymology of the term.)

##""I Have Big Bones""
Finally, check out the authorial wink to Shadrich's real business when Hibald converses with Creighton:
&gt;""The roads are full of drunken fools and despoiled maidens. As to portly knights, it is hard for any honest man to keep his belly round when so many lack for food . . . though your Ser Creighton has not hungered, it would seem.""

&gt;""**I have big bones,**"" Ser Creighton insisted.

Actually, Creighton, it's *Shadrich* who has the ""big bones"": *Lord Eddard Stark's* bones.

##Os-names of History &amp; ASOAIF
Before I wrap up, I need to talk about an elephant in the room. The Os-named Kettleblacks—Oswell, Osfryd, Osney, and Osmund—are pretty clearly nodding to King/Saint Oswald, his predecessor Osric, his successors Oswy and Oswine, and his niece Osthyrth, and also to King Osmund, a king of one of the other seven kingdoms of the Heptarchy, who ruled jointly with *another* Oswald and an Oslac.

I believe we can now explain why ASOS ""mistakenly"" calls Osmund ""Oswald"" twice: it's because the ASOIAF Os-names (among other things) are riffing on a history centered on King/Saint Oswald. But I'm not sure that GRRM simply became confused because of this and erred, as we've been led to believe. Might Jaime's and Tyrion's infamous mistakes be *intentional*? Might this be ASOS coyly tipping us off to the importance of the historical Os-kings to ASOIAF by having Jaime and Tyrion brain fart? That would explain why the ""errors"" *still* aren't corrected, despite countless printings. And it would mean that rather than winking at his own error when he had Penny confused ""Osmund"" and ""Oswald"" in ADWD—
&gt;Penny shook her head. ""She never … it was a man who came to us, in Pentos. Osmund. No, Oswald. Something like that."" (DWD Ty VIII)

—GRRM was fleshing out the connection he was making by having Jaime and Tyrion misspeak in ASOS (while gleefully aware everyone would misread this).

So what's the point of the Kettleblacks' given names (and of the ""Oswald"" non-errors, if they weren't errors)? I think GRRM uses the fact that the Kettleblacks clearly nod to the history of Northumbria and to Saint Oswald to ever so subtly tie *Shadrich* to that history and thus connote that he's moving Ned's bones. How so?

The very first time we read about the ""Kettleblacks"", they're simply but memorably described as ""unsavory""—
&gt;Ser Osmund Kettleblack, and his equally **unsavory** brothers Osney and Osfryd. (COK Ty IX)

—which just so happens to be *exactly* what Brienne thinks about hedge knights when she meets Sers Illifer and Creighton, scant pages before she meets the ""hedge knight"" Ser Shadrich:
&gt;Hedge knights had an **unsavory** reputation… (FFC B I)

And when Brienne later thinks that…
&gt;Some [who are looking for Sansa] may even be less savory than Ser Shadrich. (FFC B I)

…she's surely implying Shadrich himself is ""unsavory"".

Unsavory Shadrich is thus *like* the unsavory Kettleblacks, who are in turn (by virtue of their Os-names) *like* the historical Oswald. By transitive property, then, Shadrich is thus associated with the story of the door being shut on St. Oswald's bones in Lindsey, and with St. Oswald's skull ending up on Holy Island, which is consistent with the hypothesis that Shadrich moves at least Ned Stark's skull to the Quiet Isle.

##End
That wraps it up. Ser Shadrich, the Mad Mouse of Shady Glen, is Lord Howland Reed of Greywater Watch, who is taking Ned Stark's skull if not skeleton to the Quiet Isle when Brienne meets him, and who later heads to the Vale to attend to Sansa in league with his companions Sers Morgarth and Byron, who are also not as the seem.

I've written about ""Morgarth""—who we first meet as ""Elder Brother"" of Quiet Isle—before, and have completed a massive revision/expansion of my arguments about who he is and how he fits into the secret history of House Martell, which I'll be posting sooner than later. After that, I'll be posting the long-delayed Part 3 of my series on Tyrek Lannister (containing still more regarding Shadrich/Howland), which is also complete.

You may recall that in ""Tyrek Part 2"", I argued that we've been given every reason to believe that Tyrek is ""now"" Ser Byron The Beautiful, one of Ser Shadrich's/Howland's companions in the Vale, but concluded with a twist/cliffhanger by saying that I nevertheless do not believe Byron is actually Tyrek. While the piece you've just read treated the idea that Howland Reed is masquerading as Ser Shadrich in isolation—as interesting and important for its own sake—and while it is intentionally written to focus narrowly on that ""fact"", I do admit that I revisited this topic with the hope that if I could herein ""prove"" to a few skeptics that Howland Reed is (or at least very well could be) Ser Shadrich, that epiphany might open some minds to the possibility that Shadrich being Howland is just one piece in a larger structure of related mysteries in the Vale and elsewhere involving persons who are currently feigning anonymity in a fashion akin to Lord Reed.

#PS: Bonus High Level Tin Foil
The fact that Bowen Marsh is clearly a crannogman, probably with the blood of the old Marsh Kings, has some interesting global consequences. Those who have read [my essay on the Gemstone Emperors](https://asongoficeandtootles.wordpress.com/2016/02/29/the-gemstone-emperors-of-the-dawn-a-complete-taxonomy/) may remember my argument that the Bloodstone Emperor was both (a) a proto-Reed/Marsh King (bloodstone being moss green in color, like Jojen's eyes) and (b) Azor Ahai, whereas the Amethyst Empress was both a Dayne and the Bloodstone Emperor's Nissa Nissa. Recall:
&gt;""A hundred days and a hundred nights he labored on the third blade, and as it glowed white-hot in the sacred fires, he summoned his wife. 'Nissa Nissa,' he said to her, for that was her name, 'bare your breast, and know that I love you best of all that is in this world.' She did this thing, why I cannot say, and Azor Ahai thrust the smoking sword through her living heart. It is said that her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon, but her blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel. Such is the tale of the forging of Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes. (COK Dav I)

I happen to be of the firm conviction that Jon Snow is Lightbringer personified—a Mithras figure. I have unpublished work on this idea that goes far beyond the posts of westeros.org poster ""Schmendrick"", who first proposed the idea in detail. Unlike Schmendrick, however, I do not buy RLJ (save as a well-executed red herring that's obtained the currency of fact because of social dynamics [and, lately, a reputedly terrible television show]). 

Now, what does Bowen Marsh, scion of the line of the Bloodstone Emperors and thus an unlikely but unmistakable analogue to Azor Ahai, do at the end of ADWD? He plunges his blade into *Jon Snow*, AKA Lightbringer, who will as a consequence be reborn, AKA reforged. (Jon lives in a room with a friggin' forge in it, fer chrissake.) Assuming that ASOIAF once again ""rhymes"" with its history, this so happens to suggest something about Jon Snow's maternity that so happens to coincide perfectly with my pre-existing convictions. That is, if Bowen Marsh is a kind of analogue to the Marsh Kings and thus to Azor Ahai, Jon should be a kind of analogue to the Amethyst Empress (despite also being Lightbringer, because history *rhymes*, it doesn't repeat). Bowen Marsh is *a Marsh*, right? Which would make Jon… a female Dayne (a la Nissa Nissa)? Obviously not. But the *son* of a woman of House Dayne? Why, that so happens to be *exactly* who (I believe) Jon Snow is.",1,"(Spoilers Extended) My Definitive ""Howland Reed Is..."" Post, Part 2/2",36578,69

I'd like to challenge these assertions without bumping years-old threads on forums I don't use, so I'm going to do it here. LOTR is great, and I certainly don't doubt its status as a classic. But I genuinely think ASOIAF (at least the first three books) are better as literature, and deserve equal consideration as a literary classic.

But OP, you might be thinking to yourself. LOTR came first and basically birthed the fantasy genre as we know it today. LOTR deserves its status as a literary classic for being the story that birthed a genre

Fair enough. LOTR deserves its status as a literary classic for birthing the genre, I agree. However, this is an argument for LOTR, not against ASOIAF. Birthing a genre is not the only criterion for a novel being a classic work of literature. There are myriad works widely considered to be classics that did not birth their genre.

Further, this argument does not mean that LOTR is inherently superior. There is a certain subsect of people who will always defend AGOT as being the best of the ASOIAF novels because ""it started it all"". However, I think most can agree that ASOS is the stronger example of literary form. The same applies here.

&amp;#x200B;

Birthing a genre is not the only innovative thing that LOTR accomplishes, true. It sets out to be a sort of English Mythos, and was the first attempt at something like this outside of the King Arthur legends. Some say ASOIAF doesn't do anything innovative, it just builds on concepts first established in LOTR and other classics. ASOIAF is inspired by LOTR, they say, so it can't be a classic.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this argument is patently false. ASOIAF is extremely innovative. While the magical elements of Martin's magnus opus are obviously inspired heavily by Tolkein, the magical elements are not really what ASOIAF is about. They are almost an afterthought, whereas in Tolkein they were largely the focus.

The inspiration from Tolkein is something I don't deny, and Martin doesn't deny that Tolkein influenced him either. However, reading both interviews with Martin and the novels themeselves,

I do not think this influence runs as deep as some people assert. ASOIAF is, in fact, an entirely original story. I sometimes wish that the magical elements of ASOIAF were left out entirely. The story is largely an exploration of real historical concepts set in a fantastical but logically feasible world.

ASOIAF is more about medeival politics than it is about elves and dragons. Magical creatures might be part of ASOIAF, sure, but I would not say that ASOIAF is about them, would you?

Additionally, the scope of ASOIAF is something that I think has never been attempted. There is a strong argument to be made that AGOT, ACOK, and ASOS should be considered as one novel, with ASOS really being nearly 1000 pages of climax to the plot of the first two books. The scale of ASOIAF is something that I think is doubtlessly innovation. If innovation is what makes a classic, ASOIAF is a contender.

I think people don't consider ASOIAF as a literary classic for two reasons. First, it's too soon. Second, he hasn't finished the fucking books (get on that dude!)

But I think it will be considered a classic in due time, irrespective of whether or not he finishes them. With AGOT-ASOS, Martin has already accomplished a literary classic. When the bitterness towards him fades a bit with time, this will be recognized.

Tl;DR: Tolkein is a classic, but Martin is going to be too.

Food for thought.

Honestly, she won the Westerosi equivalent of the fucking power ball. The fact she screwed it up from there isn't sad, it is hilarious.    


Cersei Lannister didn't win the Iron Throne. She tripped, fell into a Rube Goldberg machine of incredible good fortune, and landed there on her face.   


The fact that the Lannisters rule in the first place following Robert's death is entirely luck. It's almost like she didn't think about it at all before she usurped the throne. Let's take a look:

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, Renly has to decide that he gets the throne just 'cuz. There is no way Cersei could have predicted Renly being the embodiment of the shruggie emoji. If Renly backed Stannis for the throne after Cersei killed Robert, she would have been totally screwed.   


Secondly, Stannis has to have a magic shadow baby, because Renly was about to smash her anyway. Dude had an army so huge that he wasn't marching to war, he was leisurely strolling to war. Was magic shadow baby part of Cersei's genius calculations?  


Third of all, Robb has to declare himself King. Stannis or Renly with the North smashes the Lannisters. Seriously, what the fuck does Robb think he's doing? Ned wanted Stannis. Cersei's entire plan hinges on Boy Scout Robb Stark not doing what his daddy would have wanted.  


Fourth, Lysa has to lose her mind. Haha just kidding, I'll give her that one, she probably could have seen that one coming.

The thing is, so much of the criticism of those two books that I read isn't really criticism of them properly. The main criticisms that I hear are:

1. People REALLY do not like the whole separated by character thing

2. Dance with dragons was apparently leading up to two big battles the whole book but George decided to save those for Winds of winter instead 

3. People complaining about the time between publication

None of these criticisms are really criticizing the actual quality of the work as far as I'm concerned. 

For the first criticism, I'm planning on reading feast and dance back to back anyways so the fact that they happen simultaneously doesn't bother me at all. Additionally, if it really makes the books that much worse I can just look up one of the half dozen or so fan reading orders that combine the two books chronologically. 

For the second criticism, what goes in what volume doesn't really bother me either. The first three books kind of blended together for me anyways, so if George decided to save some battles for the next book, big whoop. You could split the series into any number of volumes and never change a single sentence in the whole story. Heck, the series could be one giant book for all I care since I'm reading on ebook anyways. 

For the third criticism, since I'm a newcomer to the series I never had to face the wait, and I don't really mind anyways. The way I see it, rushing the man is only going to decrease the quality so let him take his time. As long as he doesn't die on us I'm not too worried about it. 

So the way I see it, 99% of the criticism of these two books isn't even really criticizing the actual quality of the work.

In this post, I hope to demonstrate the bias against the last Storm King in archmaester Gyldayn’s telling, and why we need to be skeptical of the history we are reading.

# Inviting the Enemy to Our Own Shores

Known to history as Argilac the Arrogant, King Argilac is harshly criticized for inviting Aegon the Conqueror to the mainland. But is this criticism fair? Let’s take a step back and look at the history of the Last Storm King before Aegon started his conquest:

&gt;From their great citadel Storm's End, the Storm Kings of House Durrandon had once ruled the eastern half of Westeros from Cape Wrath to the Bay of Crabs, but their powers had been dwindling for centuries. **The Kings of the Reach had nibbled at their domains from the west, the Dornishmen harassed them from the south, and Harren the Black and his ironmen had pushed them from the Trident and the lands north of the Blackwater Rush. King Argilac, last of the Durrandon, had arrested this decline for a time, turning back a Dornish invasion whilst still a boy, crossing the narrow sea to join the great alliance against the imperialist ""tigers"" of Volantis, and slaying Garse VII Gardener, King of the Reach, in the Battle of Summerfield twenty years later.** But Argilac had grown older; his famous mane of black hair had gone grey, and his prowess at arms had faded.

Here we see a king, inheriting a kingdom that has been besieged on all sides, successfully halting the enemy advances. With the looming threat of Harren the Black to the North, King Argilac reached out to Aegon Targaryen on Dragonstone for a military alliance:

&gt;Thus it was that King Argilac reached out to the Targaryens on Dragonstone, offering Lord Aegon his daughter in marriage, with all the lands east of the Gods Eye from the Trident to the Blackwater Rush as her dowry.

This is a great deal! The Storm King is an old man with no male heirs. He is offering his only daughter’s hand in marriage… That means Aegon Targaryen would become King of the Stormlands upon his death! Who wouldn’t take this deal? Apparently Aegon Targaryen.

Aegon arrogantly rejects the Storm King’s proposal. He states that three wives are too many in an already polygamous marriage, and how Harren the Black currently occupies the lands offered by the Storm King. Instead, Aegon offers his baseborn half-brother Orys Baratheon to wed the King’s daughter, and to take Massey’s Hook and lands south of the Blackwater. The terms of Aegon’s alliance are ridiculous. First of all, they are aggressive: demanding lands from an already dwindling kingdom. What kind of military alliance begins with weakening your ally? Second, Aegon must know the Westerosi attitude towards bastards, and that his marriage proposal would be taken as an insult. How could the stromlanders trust an alliance sealed by a marriage to a baseborn half-brother? What’s to stop Aegon, after he taking over the lands south of Blackwater, from conquering the weaken kingdom?

Clearly Aegon was not interested in an alliance with the Storm King. In fact, Aegon’s terms for alliance should be interpreted as a veiled threat. But not according to archmaester Gyldayn:

&gt;Plainly, the aging Storm King meant to establish the Targaryens along the Blackwater as a buffer between his own lands and those of Harren the Black.

Archmaester Gyldayn seems to suggest that, since the lands offered by the Storm King are currently controlled by Harren the Black, King Argilac is acting in bad faith. The Storm King is trying to manipulate Aegon into fighting his big rival, Harren the Black, for him. But surely with a marriage of King Argilac’s daughter to Aegon, the stormlanders would have aided in any conflict Aegon had with Harren the Black. Archmaester Gyldayn is blinded by his post-Conquest biases. King Argilac Durrandon, old of age and having no male heirs, is offering Aegon his kingdom in exchange for Aegon promising to liberate his people from the occupation and tyranny of Harren the Black.

After landing on the mouth of Blackwater Rush, Aegon, Visenya and Rhaenys divide their forces and begin their conquest in three seperate directions. In *Fire &amp; Blood,* it is made clear how their forces are outmatched by their Westerosi opposition; that is, until the dragons intervene. If Aegon didn’t have his dragons, history would **not** have dubbed him Aegon the Conqueror; he would have dubbed Aegon the Arrogant.

# Battle of the Last Storm

*Fire &amp; Blood* paints an unfavorable picture of King Argilac Durrandon: he is short-tempered and easily provoked into making irrational decisions. Let’s take the battle, referred to in history as the Last Storm, for example:

&gt;A steady rain began to fall that morning, and by midday had turned into a howling gale. **King Argilac's lords bannermen urged him to delay his attack until the next day, in hopes the rain would pass, but the Storm King outnumbered the conquerors almost two to one and had almost four times as many knights and heavy horse. The sight of the Targaryen banners flapping sodden above his own hills enraged him,** and the battle-seasoned old warrior did not fail to note that the rain was blowing from the south, into the faces of the Targaryen men on their hills. So Argilac the Arrogant gave the command to attack, and the battle known to history as the Last Storm began.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fighting lasted well into the night, a bloody business, and far less one-sided than Aegon's conquest of Harrenhal. Thrice Argilac the Arrogant led his knights against the Baratheon positions, but **the slopes were steep and the rains had turned the ground soft and muddy, so the warhorses struggled and foundered, and the charges lost all cohesion and momentum.** The stormlanders fared better when they sent their spearmen up the hills on foot. Blinded by the rain, the invaders did not see them climbing until it was too late, and the wet bowstrings of the archers made their bows useless. One hill fell, then another, and the third and final charge of the Storm King and his knights broke through the Baratheon center...only to come upon Queen Rhaenys and Meraxes. Even on the ground, the dragon proved formidable. Dickon Morrigen and the Bastard of Blackhaven, commanding the vanguard, were engulfed in dragonflame, along with the knights of King Argilac's personal guard. The warhorses panicked and fled in terror, crashing into riders behind them and turning the charge into chaos. The Storm King himself was thrown from his saddle.

Archmaester Gyldayn depicts King Argilac as so enraged about Targaryen banners on his hills that - instead of listening to his reasonable bannermen and waiting for the storm to pass - he impulsively attacks the enemy. The enemy being strategically positioned on a hill, King Argilac’s numerical advantage is negated by the rains softening the ground and causing all cavalry charges up the hill to be ineffective. This makes King Argilac an arrogant fool, does it not? No, it doesn’t.

Rather, here is a great commander in last Storm King. Upon hearing that Harren the Black was cooked alive by dragon fire after hiding in his impregnable fortress, King Argilac left Storm’s End and sought the Targaryen forces on the field. Upon hearing that his bannermen were defeated near the Wendwater because they were exposed to aerial attacks from Rhaenys’s dragon, King Argilac decided to engage the enemy under the cover of a storm. Archmaester Gyldayn even mentions in the quoted text (above) that the Targaryen forces were blinded by the rain. The same is true about Rhaenys and her dragon. Gyldayn suggests that the stormlanders were surprised to discover Meraxes behind the Targaryen line. But just consider that by engaging the enemy in the middle of a storm, King Argilac forced Rhaenys’s dragon to the ground, and a grounded dragon can be slain.

And just consider again the military history of King Argilac before Aegon’s Conquest (quoted above). Do you really think that a commander with that resume is easily provoked by his enemy to make strategically bad decisions? No, I think King Argilac was wisely adapting his tactics to fight a new kind of war: a war with dragons.

Let’s quickly jump to the conclusion of the conflict, where the dead King Argilac’s only daughter is delivered to Orys Baratheon in chains:

&gt;It is said that **Baratheon unchained her with his own hands, wrapped his cloak around her, poured her wine, and spoke to her gently,** telling her of her father's courage and the manner of his death. And afterward, to honor the fallen king, he took the arms and words of the Durrandon for his own. The crowned stag became his sigil, Storm's End became his seat, and Lady Argella his wife.

Oh how noble, gentle and kind is Orys Baratheon! For in victory, he took the daughter of the dead King - who he killed himself - to be his wife! This paragraph is dripping with propaganda. Recall that Aegon had insulted the late King with this marriage proposal before the war started. Yes, history is written by the victors.

# Engaging with the Text

*Fire &amp; Blood* starts with a long discussion about how the dates are imprecise: Aegon’s Conquest took two years, the Dornish never submitted to the Conqueror, Aegon’s reign didn’t really start until his coronation in Oldtown, and so on... Besides being a big nerd about calendars, why does Martin bother with this tedious introduction? Get to the action already, George!

No, what Martin is doing here is priming the reader to be skeptical about the history they are about to read. He wants us to engage with the text. Is Gyldayn depicting each actor in the Dance of the Dragons fairly? Should we, like Gyldayn, quickly dismiss Mushroom’s versions of events? Who was there to witness these events and tell the tale afterwards?

*Fire &amp; Blood* is **not** the conclusive history written from the perspective of George RR Martin; it is written from the perspective of an in-universe character with his own interests and cultural biases. And that’s what makes *Fire &amp; Blood* such an interesting and unique reading experience!

* **Sandor Clegane**: Sandoq the Shadow is a huge man like Sandor. His name is one letter away from Sandor and the fact that he is a mute could be a reference for Sandor taking an oath of silence on the Quiet Isle. Plus, Sandoq is fond of music and listen Larra Rogare sing while Sandor request a song from Sansa Stark and listen to her. Lastly, Sandoq has a great standoff against the Kingsguard Amaury Peake and his men on the drawbridge to Maegor's Holdfast where Sandoq protects Aegon III and Viserys. This makes me think of the scene in ACOK Sansa II where Sansa comes back from the godswood and the Kingsguard stops her on the same drawbridge. They are suspitious of her and want to sent her to Cersei until Sandor Clegane arrives and intervenes to walk her safely into Maegor's Holdfast.
* **Arya Stark**: Larra Rogare is said to be able to transform into a cat and prowl the gutters and rooftops of King’s Landing. Her cats who came and went from her chamber were said to be her spies. Plus, Larra worshiped 4 different gods including one named ""Faceless Saagael"". All this passage is very reminiscent of Arya Stark skinchanging cats as Blind Beth during her training as a Faceless man.

**There are 3 retcons involving characters I am sure about:**

1) House Hightower

The father of Ceryse Hightower has been retcon from Lord Martyn Hightower to Lord Manfred Hightower. It should be noted that it's not simply a change of name as Lord Martyn still exist and he is now Ceryse's brother instead of her father. Due to this we have two consequences to the canon:

A) Lord Manfred Hightower who was Lord of Oldtown during the Conquest is now Ceryse's great-grandfather instead of her grandfather.

B) Patrice Hightower is still a sister of a Lord Manfred Hightower but no longer the same as before since we now have 2 Lord Manfred Hightower in the beginning of the Targaryen Era: the first one being the old and godly Lord during the Conquest who dies in 10 AC and the second (grandson of the first) who dies in 41 AC.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Alyssa Velaryon’s mother

Previously Queen Alyssa Velaryon was the daughter of Lord Aethan Velaryon and his Targaryen wife, this has been retconned as now Alyssa’s mother is Lady Alarra Massey.

&amp;#x200B;

3) The first Lord Strong of Harrenhal

&gt;**Lyonel Strong, famed as a warrior but also a man of great natural gifts who had earned six links in his chain at the Citadel, was granted the lordship in the reign of Jaehaerys I**. He served as master of laws, then Hand to Viserys I, while his sons became deeply entangled in the court.  
&gt;  
&gt;*The World of Ice - The Riverlands: House Tully*

It’s not the case anymore, the Lordship of Harrenhal was granted after Rhaena Targaryen’s death in 73 AC to Ser Bywin Strong, brother of Lucamore Strong of the Kingsguard. Lord Lyonel Strong is a descendant of Ser Bywin (probably his son given the timeline).

&amp;#x200B;

**The other changes I detected to whom I don't know the reason why are:**

1. Formely in the canon Ser Tyler Hill, known as the Bastard of Lannispor, was a man who fought and died in the Battle by the Lakeshore in 130 AC. His name has been changed into Ser Emory Hill (page 461). But we now have another Ser Tyler Hill in the canon: Ser Tyler Hill, the bastard son of Lord Lyman Lannister who fought in the Battle Beneath the Gods Eye in 43 AC (page 88).
2. Grand Maester Myres’s name change into Myros (page 80).
3. The Lord Darry during Maegor I’s reign was previously Lord Dormand Darry, it now has been changed into Lord Darnold Darry (page 94).
4. Ser Willum Royce who wielded the Valyrian sword Lamentation during the Dance of the Dragons is changed into Ser Willam Royce (page 515).
5. I don’t know why but Lord Rowan present at the Battle Beneath the Gods Eye in 43 AC was replaced by Lord Peake in *Fire &amp; Blood* (page 89). Same for “the son and heir of Lord Rowan” killed by Warrior’s Sons led by Ser Joffrey Doggett in *Sons of the Dragon* has been replaced by “the son and heir of Lord Peake” in *Fire &amp; Blood* (page 92).

&amp;#x200B;

# 3) Printing errors I found

* Hobert Hightower

Hobert Hightower’s name is misspelled as “Hobart Hightower” (page 530).

* Trystane Truefyre

In the chapter “*The Dying of the Dragons - The Short, Sad Reign of Aegon II*” at the page 561, Trystane Truefyre’s name is misspelled as “Trystan”.

* **Lord ""Olyvar"" Baratheon and his grandfather**

There is an inconsistency about the father and son of Lady Elenda Baratheon (wife of Lord Borros Baratheon).

It is said in the footnote of the page 563 that Elenda named her baby son Olyver in honor of her father but later in page 593 Elenda’s father is Lord Royce Caron. Plus, in the footnote the infant’s name is spelled “Olyver” but in page 609 it is “Olyvar”. Since there are already several “Olyvar” in the canon but no “Olyver” (except for Ser Olyver Bracken introduced in Fire &amp; Blood, which was pointed out in the comments by  u/Bennings463), I guess the name of this Lord Baratheon is Olyvar instead of Olyver. Am I right to assume this? And also on page 697, Elenda is twice misspelled as “Elendra”.

The simplest way to make these inconsistencies disappear would be to not consider the footnote from page 563. That way Lord Royce Caron stays the father of Elenda and the baby Lord Baratheon is named Olyvar without an explication of the name’s provenance.

* **Dalton Greyjoy’s salt wives**

In *The World of Ice and Fire - The Iron Islands: The Red Kraken*, Lord Dalton Greyjoy takes 4 of Lord Farman’s daughter as salt wives and gives the 5^(th) to his brother Veron Greyjoy. The same thing is said in *Fire &amp; Blood* at the page 473 but later it is mentioned that only 2 daughters of Lord Farman are Dalton’s salt wives (page 655).

* **Robert Rowan**

In the last chapter at page 678, Ser Robert Rowan the son and heir of the Hand of the King Thaddeus Rowan is once mentioned as “Lord Robert“ instead of “Ser Robert”.

0,1,0,13,63,"Hi everyone, I'm new to posting so if it's not in the right format, I'm sorry. I was rereading ACOK chapter 48 (When Dany goes to the warlock tower and gets all those prophecies) because I wanted to count the total number of prophecies I could find. I noticed this line that I never put much thought into before: 

   ""Other sounds, even more disturbing, came through some of the closed doors. One shook and thumped, as if someone were trying to break through. From another came a dissonant piping that  made the dragon lash his tail wildly from side to side. Dany hurried quickly past.""

  I can't help but wonder if this is foreshadowing the famous 'Hold the door' scene. Notice that the sentence starts with 'Others.' Others refers to the white walkers and is usually capitalized in the sentence but we might overlook this initially because it also happens to be the first word in the sentence. 

  It then describes the sound as if someone was trying to break through and the sound was even describe as disturbing.

  I never noticed the text before because I always just assumed Dany's visions were the ones she sees and it never occurred to me that they also include the ones she hears.

  My apologies if this has been brought up before. Either way, I must say Bravo to George RR Martin for his fantastic writing and his subtle skills. 

Edit: cleaning up wording and adding flair 

Edit 2: spelling

Edit 3- some other things that are worth noting when you look at what she hears. 

   ‘Dany could hear sounds within the walls, a faint scurrying and scrabbling that made her think of rats.’ Which is a nice comparison to King’s Landing an how Varys uses the hollow walls to obtain secrets. 

  And this interesting moment:

  It seemed as though she walked for another hour before the long hall finally ended in a steep stone stair, descending into darkness. Every door, open or closed, had been to her left. Dany looked behind her. The torches were going out, she realized with fear. Perhaps twenty still burned. Thirty at most. One more guttered out even as she watched, darkness came a little farther down the hall, creeping toward her. And as she listened it seemed as if she heard something else coming, shuffling and dragging itself slowly along the faded carpet. Terror filled her. She could not go back and she was afraid to stay here, but how could she go on? There was no door on her right, and the steps went down, not up.  Yet another torch went out as she stood pondering, and the sounds grew faintly louder. Drogon’s long neck snaked out and he opened his mouth to scream, steam rising from between his teeth. He hears it too [Dany thinks]. . . . Another torch goes out. 

  It sounds like to me this is describing the Others. If fire means life, as noted numerous times in the series, could the torches going out symbolize death? It’s also interesting that the phrase darkness creeping up on her is mentioned numerous times. As she listens, she hears something dragging itself on the carpet toward her, something terrifying. Could this be wights? ",1,(Spoilers Extended) Foreshadowing from ACOK Ch 48?,3070,50

At 15 Alyn Velaryon was able to pull a dick move on Aegon II.

&gt;In the waning days of 130 AC, King Aegon II returned at last to King’s Landing, accompanied by Ser Marston Waters, Ser Alfred Broome, the Two Toms, and Lady Baela Targaryen (still in chains, for fear she might attack the king if freed). Escorted by twelve Velaryon war galleys, they sailed upon a battered old trading cog named *Mouse,* owned and captained by Marilda of Hull. If Mushroom may be trusted, **the choice of vessel was deliberate. “Lord Alyn might have shipped the king home aboard** ***Lord Aethan’s Glory*** **or** ***Morning Tide*** **or even** ***Spicetown Girl,*** **but he wanted him seen to be creeping into the city on a mouse**,” the dwarf says. “Lord Alyn was an insolent boy and did not love his king.”

&gt;As the great war fleet passed through the Gullet, Ser Gedmund sent over Blackbean to Lord Alyn’s flagship, *Queen Rhaenys,* with a letter authorizing him to take command of the Velaryon squadrons, “so that they may benefit from his many years of experience.” Lord Alyn sent him back. “I would have hanged him,” he wrote to Ser Gedmund, “but I am loath to waste good hempen rope on a bean.”

[The Far-Southeast](https://i.redd.it/6za6t5oxby021.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the only mention of the Saffron Straits in any of the books, a quote from the WOIAF

&gt;Easternmost and southernmost of the great cities of the known world, the ancient port of Asshai stands at the end of a long wedge of land, on the point where the Jade Sea meets the **Saffron Straits**.

&amp;#x200B;

We can assume by its name that it is used for transporting saffron, and a **strait** is a ""narrow passage of water connecting two seas or two other large areas of water"".

&amp;#x200B;

Euron mysteriously arrives in the Iron Isles with saffron.

&gt;Euron had seduced them with his glib tongue and smiling eye and bound them to his cause with the plunder of half a hundred distant lands; gold and silver, ornate armor, curved swords with gilded pommels, daggers of Valyrian steel, striped tiger pelts and the skins of spotted cats, jade manticores and ancient Valyrian sphinxes, chests of nutmeg, cloves, and **saffron**, ivory tusks and the horns of unicorns, green and orange and yellow feathers from the Summer Sea, bolts of fine silk and shimmering samite...

&amp;#x200B;

Here we have evidence of a saffron trader in the Westerlands - more specifically around Lannisport, by the Sunset Sea.

&gt;The Westerlings always did have more honor than sense. **Lady Sybell's grandfather was a trader in saffron and pepper**, almost as lowborn as that smuggler Stannis keeps. And the grandmother was some woman he'd brought back from the east...

Why would a saffron trader be on the Western coast?

Are these subtle hints towards it being possible to sail between Asshai and Westeros?

&amp;#x200B;

There are three possibilities:

1. These straits lead to an unknown sea; there is a civilisation interested in saffron which is West of the Sunset Sea
2. These straits lead directly to the Sunset Sea; the saffron is traded in Ulthos or sailed around the East of Essos to Mossovy or the Thousand Islands
3. These straits lead directly to the Sunset Sea; the saffron is traded in Westeros

0,1,0,36,13,"So... Dorne seems to be one of the biggest areas of divergence between the books and the show. Without judging the comparable quality of either, here's where Dorne stands in both.


**The show:**

* The Sand Snakes and Ellaria Sand kill Myrcella in revenge for Oberyn's death in King's Landing

* They kill Doran, Areo Hotah, and Trystane and take control of Dorne

* Dorne under Ellaria Sand allies with Daenerys against the Lannisters

* The Sand Snakes get captured and killed by Cersei and Euron


**The books:**

* Quentyn is dead in Meereen

* Doran reveals to Arianne plans to ally with the dragons and go to war against the Lannisters (Ellaria Sand does not like this at all)

* Arianne travels for Storm's End to meet her (alleged) cousin, Aegon

* Arys Oakhart is dead by Areo Hotah's hand and Myrcella Baratheon has been maimed (allegedly by Gerold Dayne).

* Doran sends Areo Hotah (and Obara Sand I think?) to guide Balon Swann to High Hermitage to kill everyone's favorite Dornishman, the ~~Dorkstar~~ Darkstar

* The Sand Snakes go off in different directions to get close to important people (Cersei's Small Council and the High Septon, iirc)

* Ellaria leaves Sunspear for Hellholt, her father's home

**Questions for the books (because I generally don't know):**

* Do we think the ~~Dorkstar~~ Darkstar actually attacked Myrcella?

* Do we think the girl Balon sees actually *is* Myrcella?


So these are two wildly divergent paths. Granted, the show is further along, but it doesn't look like the books will have the same endgame. *Or will it?*

Obviously, the same events won't happen, but considering the showrunners of *Game of Thrones* know where the books are headed, I think the events of the show can at least give us hints as to what Dorne might look like at the end of TWOW.

Firstly, Dorne seems to finally be going to war. Finally, Doran has made concrete moves towards allying with both Dany and Aegon. The Dany one did *not* pan out, but it's very likely that Arianne and Aegon will work together. So if and when Aegon and Dany go to war, Dorne will be caught in the middle. 

Secondly, we do see some tension between Ellaria and Doran. Ellaria worries that Doran's schemes will put her daughters in danger. While it's worth noting that this is the inverse of her conflict with Doran in the show, couldn't this be a motive for Ellaria to turn on Doran? When they learn of Quentyn's death, maybe Ellaria sees something like that for her daughters?

Then we come to one of the  biggest structural problems for Dorne in Winds, in my opinion. With Arianne going to meet Aegon, the only Dornish POV we have is Areo. He's off hunting the dork of the night, so we don't have eyes inside Sunspear for Winds. That's not inherently a problem, but *what if Areo dies?* We know that he, Balon, and Obara are headed to High Hermitage. If the ~~Dorkstar~~ Darkstar really is as dangerous as Doran and GRRM say he is, then I'm betting he's not just gonna submit meekly, right? Especially if he knows that Areo was the one who killed Arys Oakhart. So I'm going to say right here that either Balon Swann or Areo Hotah gets killed when Darkstar reveals that Areo killed Arys (gut feeling says Areo bites it at some point in Winds). But that just leaves more questions! 

If Balon dies and Areo lives, does Areo kill the Darkstar? Does he even *want* to, or does Doran have an ulterior motive?

If Areo dies and Balon lives, does Balon kill the Darkstar? Does *he* even want to, or will the Darkstar convince him to get the Lannisters to declare war on Dorne?

What is the Darkstar's play here? We are consistently told how dangerous he is, but he doesn't seem to have any ambitions beyond being an edgy dick. If he doesn't die at the hands of Balon or Areo, I'm sure he becomes a pain in Doran's ass. Could that contribute to the fall of House Martell? But if Aegon takes King's Landing, won't he turn his sights on anyone challenging the Martells in Dorne? And without a POV in Dorne, how will we know what happens?

**Summary:**

I kinda got  sidetracked there at the end, but my point is that while Dorne seems wildly different between the books and the show, I think they are headed for a similar endgame.

* Dorne backs the dragon (one of them, at least) against the Lannisters

* House Martell facing a power struggle and maybe even falling because of it

But I have no idea how Winds can simplify Dorne lol. I totally get how GRRM said he has enough material for like ten books. Dorne alone could take up like one or two of them.

So i'm just gonna quote both of these great metas in this post.

# By zaldrizer-sovesi:

A couple of disclaimers: I’m not particularly well-versed in child development, so I don’t know how much of this is psychology and how much it’s character construction. Also, this isn’t meant as a defense of the decisions Renly ends up making, but a look at how he became the person who would make those choices.

Renly was 21 as of ACOK, which means he can’t have been more than six during Robert’s Rebellion. The Siege of Storm’s End shaped Stannis as a commander; it shaped Renly as a person. This is no small thing.

&gt;“Near the end, Ser Gawen Wylde and three of his knights tried to steal out a postern gate to surrender. Stannis caught them and ordered them flung from the walls with catapults. I can still see Gawen’s face as they strapped him down. He had been our master-at-arms.”Lord Rowan appeared puzzled. “No men were hurled from the walls. I would surely remember that.”“Maester Cressen told Stannis that we might be forced to eat our dead, and there was no gain in flinging away good meat.” (ACOK, Catelyn IV)

What in the world was a *six-year-old* doing in the cannibalism policy talks?!

Renly’s choices are Renly’s responsibility, and the foundations for the Baratheon tragedy were laid by people and forces far removed from the current players. Still, there’s some reason to look back a bit critically at Maester Cressen. The maesters of noble houses tend to have a fair amount of responsibility for the well-being of the children of those houses, even when the kids’ parents are still around. Of course small Renly used to skip around playing pretend. Not only was there no one who could shelter him from his rat-eating reality, but - look, it’s not like Renly was peeking around a corner here, you don’t accidentally strap someone to a catapult in your living area. Someone should’ve put their foot down and said a little kid didn’t need to be in eyeshot or earshot of creative executions. Stannis was in no way equipped to be raising his brother, but I don’t think he would have gone against someone who did step to at least try to shelter Renly where possible. We don’t know enough about Cressen to know why he failed to do this, but for Renly, it does all add up to abandonment issues.

And going from there, it’s not too much of a reach to connect some of these dots. Renly’s love of luxury is not unrelated to that formative experience of deprivation. It’s not impossible to imagine that he considers admiration to be a life-and-death issue because for that one year of his childhood he was keenly aware of his dependence on others as a matter of survival. His [wildly destabilizing](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Ftowerofthehand.com%2Fblog%2F2013%2F06%2F17-hollow-crowns-deadly-thrones%2Findex.html&amp;t=NGVlZTJkM2MwNTE5MGQzYzRhMmJjYWI4ZTk2NzU4NjdmZGE4N2ViNyxHU2d2Vzl3aQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AiOYfC33RL-f4tCTbzWu0iQ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fzaldrizer-sovesi.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F124948396552%2Frenly-and-the-sieges-of-storms-end&amp;m=1) political ideology makes sense coming from a person who has always understood the world as a fundamentally insecure place.

This leads to adult Renly, whose actions - or, more to the point, the actions he didn’t take - suggest someone who is more interested in *acclaim* than he is in *power*. If ACOK Renly is really trying to take the throne, then surely his best move would have been to back Stannis off the bat, let him bear half the costs of bringing down the Lannisters and do the dirty work of eliminating Cersei and her children, and then arrange for some misfortune to befall Stannis before he and Selyse manage to have a son. Instead, he puts himself and his campaign at some risk in order to be seen and chosen over his brother by the people of Westeros.

It’s this point that has kept me only mostly, rather than entirely, on board with the [more cynical readings of Renly’s character](http://asoiafuniversity.tumblr.com/post/118611443491/can-i-ask-what-you-mean-about-renlys). It gives him either too much or too little credit to analyze him as an *effective* schemer, because he somehow managed to miss the easiest route to the Iron Throne. It’s possible that pretending to support his brother while plotting against him was a bridge too far in some personal honor code. But I think it’s more likely that Renly cares more about being seen winning than he actually does in having power and using it for something.

Instead, he works hard against his own interests in fighting Stannis and joining up *with the Tyrells*. Letting go of a grudge is one thing, but Renly’s reliance on Mace Tyrell is something else entirely. There’s something there, with Renly moving against Stannis with the backing of the man who did that to them. Did he, somewhere in his little kid brain, blame Stannis for his refusal to surrender to Mace? Was it about taking ownership of the experience by using Mace in what he sees as an imitation of Robert’s Rebellion, or winning Mace’s favorite child away from him?

I don’t know. Renly’s a mystery in some ways. He’s a cipher - a cipher on purpose, I think, a person who cultivated the ability to be seen as all things to all people. And I think this is at least partly due to his having been at the eye of a storm when he was just old enough to realize it. *Look at me, I’m alive.*

# By nobodysuspectsthebutterfly:

Children aren’t rational. Children don’t understand what’s best for them. You take your kid to the doctor and give him a shot, he’ll scream. He’ll hate the doctor, he’ll say he hates you. It doesn’t matter that it’s for his health, he’s in pain and he hates what’s causing him pain.

So, [six-year-old Renly is starving and having to eat his pony and his dogs and his cats and rats](http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/172895601173/do-you-have-any-art-post-or-reblog-about-young), and why? Because Stannis is stubborn. Because Stannis is mean. Yes, Cressen is explaining it’s important to keep Storm’s End for Robert, that Stannis just wants Renly to be safe, but Renly looks at the Tyrells out there, [so pretty and green](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fasearchoficeandfire.com%2F%3Fq%3DEven%2Bas%2Ba%2Bboy%252C%2BRenly%2Bhad%2Bloved%2Bbright%2Bcolors%2Band%2Brich%2Bfabrics&amp;t=ZDcyOTA4YjUwMWE2M2VhMjI1OTNmMzk3NTViYzgzMTk5OTVmMDIxNixpMldIOFJiOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A5D250EBjdM6R0NChk3TG9Q&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fnobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F172957808978%2Fi-am-empathetic-i-fully-understand-the-trauma-of&amp;m=0) and nice… and they have so much food… it smells so good, Stannis… please, I’m sure they’d be nice, Stannis, I’m so hungry… please, Stannis, please… Robert would do it, wouldn’t he? Why are you always so mean, Stannis?! I hate you! I hate you forever and ever!

And that sticks. [Trauma sticks](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FComplex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder&amp;t=Y2Q0NWRhOTIwNjdjMTQ2MDAxMzQ3OTUxYTI0ZGY1YjVkOGM2Y2Y5OSxpMldIOFJiOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A5D250EBjdM6R0NChk3TG9Q&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fnobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F172957808978%2Fi-am-empathetic-i-fully-understand-the-trauma-of&amp;m=0). Young Renly (who lost his parents as a baby, might not have even been weaned when they had to leave for the Free Cities) wasn’t rational enough to realize it was the Tyrells who were to blame, not rational enough to think his far-away hero Robert would have done the same as Stannis; instead, he focuses on Stannis as the cause of his pain, the one who’s telling him no, the one who makes his tummy growl at night. Yes, the war ended, he grew older, he consciously learned better, he knew the Tyrells were part of the loyalist enemies, he *knew* it had all been done for his best… But the child deep inside, his subconscious mind still feels that pain in his stomach whenever he looks at Stannis… and associates the Tyrells with luxury and food and pleasure. Pleasure he takes with both hands, [never refusing to taste a peach](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fasearchoficeandfire.com%2F%3Fq%3DA%2Bman%2Bshould%2Bnever%2Brefuse%2Bto%2Btaste%2Ba%2Bpeach%252C%2522%2BRenly%2Bsaid%2Bas%2Bhe%2Btossed%2Bthe%2Bstone%2Baway.%2B%2522He%2Bmay%2Bnever%2Bget%2Bthe%2Bchance%2Bagain.%2BLife%2Bis%2Bshort%252C%2BStannis&amp;t=NDA4ODBjYzgwNGQ0Nzg0NjFjYzcwNjU4YzdhZmI0ZmY3OTJiYmI4YixpMldIOFJiOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A5D250EBjdM6R0NChk3TG9Q&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fnobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F172957808978%2Fi-am-empathetic-i-fully-understand-the-trauma-of&amp;m=0). And Loras comes to be his squire when he’s about 16 or so, and shows him that the Tyrells are human, they aren’t some monsters, they’re real people, they’re kind and loving… He visits Highgarden, green and gold and soft and pretty like his dreams… and Mace is a good man, a good father, generous and kind, like the father he never had… supportive, so proud of Loras, so proud of him, willing to give Renly anything he needs, anything he wants…

Renly was:as an infant, abandoned by his parents (not their fault that they never returned, but nevertheless)

* abandoned by his older brother shortly thereafter (as [Robert preferred to stay in the Vale with Jon Arryn and Ned Stark](http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/162706628818/hello-is-there-something-more-to-the-fact-that); and probably only came home once in a while to dazzle Renly with hugs and laughter and gifts, much to Stannis’s frustration)
* at age 6, forced to live in suffering by serious and mean Stannis (per his child’s mind)
* at age 7, abandoned by his brother Stannis and his caretaker Maester Cressen (when they left for Dragonstone)
* raised by servants thereafter, the lord of his castle

and you wonder why he has attachment problems? Why he cares for strangers more than he does his family? Why he’s more materialistic than altruistic?

That’s what I mean by empathy. Don’t look at things how you would react to them, how *you* would think as an adult. If you can imagine being Stannis (age 19, starving, desperately trying to make it from day to day, to survive, to keep your men alive, because it’s your duty, because Robert charged you with this duty, even though you have that nagging thought about how you’re disobeying your king, wouldn’t it be easier to just give up… but no, you must go on, you *have* to, for Robert, for Renly, to spit in the eye of those damn Tyrells), if you can imagine being a traumatized barely-adult, then you can try and drop down even further and imagine being a traumatized child as well.

# Conclusion

I think these metas do a great job of explaining Renly's view on life. I walys look at the siege of Storm's End as a defining moment in shaping Stannis, but i never considered that it might have been the same for Renly.

Everything, from his love of bright colors and fancy dresses, to his alliance with the Tyrells and his political campaign is tied to his child trauma. And it makes it even more sad, when you realise that it ends with Stannis and the Storm's End for him, just like it started. *Oh, Renly, Renly, dear sweet child, do you know what you are doing? And would you care if you did?*

and even presumed to lecture them. “If I had not become queen, I might have
liked to be a maester,” she told the Conclave. “I read, I write, I think, I am not
afraid of ravens…or a bit of blood. There are other highborn girls who feel
the same. Why not admit them to your Citadel? If they cannot keep up, send
them home, the way you send home boys who are not clever enough. If you
would give the girls a chance, you might be surprised by how many forge a

bobbed their heads and assured Her Grace that they would consider her
proposal.

We know the maesters wanted to get rid of dragons because they hated magic. Maybe it is just a coincidence. But the maester conspiracy to get rid of dragons supposedly began just one generation after Alysanne. From the above passage, it looks like neither the maesters at the Citadel nor archmaester Gyldane himself ""presumed to lecture them"" weren't too pleased by Alysanne's diktats.

0,1,0,53,0,"OK, so hear me out. Yes, this is about how in the show Rhaegar annuls his marriage to Elia and how that makes him a monster.

Let me be clear, I do think Rhaegar is an idiot. The man clearly had no real plan for what was happening and was just going around assuming that he would be fine. His whole thing with Elia and Lyanna is weird and messed up. No one is denying that and no one should deny that.

This post is just a out how the annulment is not the worst option on the table.

Now, many people believe that Rhaegar in the books would want to marry both Lyanna and stay married to Elia and their kids would rule together and all that.

The only issue here is that you run into the same issues as with the annulment, mainly that you're left with a bunch of pissed off lords, nobles, and peasants who are not going to be happy that Rhaegar started a war just so he could be married to two beautiful women. This isn't even a Henry the VIII situation because Rhaegar has an heir, his son Aegon, as well as a younger brother. Rhaegar would also be coming into a bad situation where his country was torn apart, thus there's no guarantee that these angry people are going to want to deal with him when they have Robert or whoever else can be found. You know, someone who didn't cause civil war because he wanted two wives.

At least with the annulment, Rhaegar isn't trying to have his cake and eat it too. He's also making Elia a less desirable hostage and is giving her a way out and make to Dorne. With an annulment, he's also able to potentially bring his older children back into the line of sussession later.

As for the show having Lyanna call Jon Aegon, well, thay could be lazy writing, or it could be that that was just a backup name or maybe Lyanna knew Rhaegar's other children were dead and thus she decided to try and make one last power play with Jon's name if someone had to use it.",1,(Spoilers Main) The Annulment isn't that bad of an idea,1897,55

Welcome to the Fire and Blood awards, where I, award prizes to the strangest, coolest and best moments in Fire and Blood Vol. 1

**Award for the Sweetest moment goes to:**

Rhaena Targaryens calm last years at Harrenhal, and the small detail that she and Maegor Towers had a ”queer friendship of sorts”. 

**Award for the most disgusting death:**

Poor Aerera Targaryen that unwillingly took a trip to Valyria on Balerion the Black Dread. That was messed up.

**Award for the most distracting thing in the book:**

Grover, Elmo and *especially* Kermit Tully. It was tolerable in TWOIAF, as they were just mentioned. But here they were supposed to be fleshed out characters and i can’t really take Kermit Tully seriously, sorry.

**Award for best easter (or dragon) egg:**

Aegon the Unworthy making an apperance, trying to kill his own little brother with a god damn dragon egg. He was an asshole even as a little baby!

**Award for the character that most likely had some kind of mental issues:** 

Racallio Ryndoon. Hey, i can kill you anytime i want. Wanna conquer Tyrosh? We should wrestle! IN MUD! Do you like my purple orange hair? Do you think it should be more orange or more purple? Be honest. I CAN FIGHT WITH TWO SWORDS! That girl is pretty, i will set her free! And then i will beg her to beat me. While wearing a dress. Hahahaha! Please behead these three guys, by the way. And fuck two of my wives. You want to leave now? Well… ok. But you have to give me three ships first! And a kiss!

**Award for ”can you please write this too George?:**

”Sea Demons: A History of the Children of the Drowned God” by Archmaester Mancaster. I would just love to read a whole book about Greyjoy shenanigans.

**Award for the biggest bro:**

Septon Barth! It’s very apparent that he was a big reason that Jaehaerys reign went so smooth as it did and he didn't try to get any credit for it.

**Award for the best feminist:**

Good Queen Alyssane. I'm so sad that she didn't try to press on the issue that women should be able to go to the citadel as well. I studied gender studies a few years back and remember that it was in the 18th century that someone brought up the question as to why women can't go to the university. The argument was quite similar to the one Alysanne had. ""If we think women aren't as smart as men, then why are we afraid of letting them study at the university?""

**Award for the most corny moment:**

When Jaehaerys had to have some ”badass moment” and killed the vulture king. It just seemed kinda forced to me.

**Award for the most awesome character:**

Rogar Baratheon’s whole life was just simply amazing. Backing up Jaehearys claim, becoming a traitor, then a redemption and then wanting to go out and die in Dorne, but died calmly in his bed. He also reminds me of how much I miss Robert Baratheon since A Game of Thrones. With many similarities in the good ways, but also very different flaws.

**Award for ”huh, this house didn’t get much action after this, did they?”:**

House Velaryon. Wed to Targaryens, had two of the most badass characters in this book, but in the main series they’re mostly some kind of hangaround to Stannis or bastards that steals ships from Cersei because they can.

**Award for the ”why am i constantly shat on?”:**

Gaemon Palehair, also known as ”the cunny king”. Proclaimed innocent after the crazy riots, he gets to live in a castle. Pretty cool for a lowborn boy. And he’s the kings only friend! Yaay! But wait: Anytime the king doesn’t want to train you get your ass whooped, that king in question glady ignores you ever existed as soon as his brother comes back to court and yeah, here’s some poison that will perish your little nine year old body. 

**Award for the most ”yeah i’ll just make some shit up”:**

The gods of Lys: The six-breasted cat goddess Pantera, Yndros of the Twilight who was male by day and female by night, the pale child Bakkalon of the Sword, faceless Saagael, the giver of pain.

**Award for my biggest gasp:**

That The Burned Men of the mountain clans that worshipped a fire witch was revealed to be Nettles and sheepstealer! I might have read a theory about it here on reddit sometime back, and the fact that it’s now confirmed made me very happy.

**Award for the biggest rebel:**

Saera Targaryen. I remember reading the first part about her personality as a child and then her companionship with both girls and boys on ships and I was like ”yeah, they are fucking. That’s some big ass teenage orgies on boats right there”. I was almost surprised about how right i was. And i was happy that she actually just said no to the life at court and did her own thing. I mean, luxury prositution is probably not an optimal thing to do, but in that kind of world maybe that was the best she could achieve. And after gaining lots of gold and power, she probably could make some demands of her own. I sure hope so at least. I liked her.

0,1,0,0,2,"So we have this entire exchange between Rhaena and Franklyn Farman when Rhaena went searching for Areara after she disappeared on Balerion. Rhaena and Farman shared past enmity because Rhaena had taken with her Elissa Farman as her lover, against Franklyn's wishes. There was a huge incident when Elissa escaped with Rhaena including physical scuffles. 

&gt;The years had not made
his lordship any fonder of the queen, nor any wiser in how he chose to speak
to her. “I had hoped my lady sister might come home to do her duty once she
fled from you,” Lord Franklyn said, “but we have had no word of her, nor of
your daughter. I cannot claim to know the princess, but I would say she is
well rid of you, as was Fair Isle. If she turns up here we shall see her off, just
as we did her mother.”

&gt;“You do not know Aerea, that much is true,” Her Grace responded. “If she
does indeed find her way to these shores, my lord, you may find she is not as
forbearing as her mother. Oh, and I wish you luck if you should try to ‘see
off’ the Black Dread. Balerion quite enjoyed your brother, by now he may
desire another course.”

F&amp;B notes that Jahaerys was unhappy with Rhaena's words. 

&gt; The lords of the realm are proud
men all, and little is gained by shaming them. A wise king will always let
them keep their dignity. Show them a dragon, aye. They will remember.
Speak openly of burning down their halls, boast of how you fed their own kin
to your dragons, and you will only inflame them and set their hearts against
you.”

Jahaerys himself says the following when one of his councilmen spoke up against Rhaena. 

&gt;The accounts
of Rhaena’s confrontation with Lord Farman on Fair Isle had appalled the
king and his lords alike. “Is she mad, to speak so to a lord in his own hall?”
Lord Smallwood said. “Had it been me, I would have had her tongue out.” To
which the king replied, “I hope you would not truly be so foolish, my lord.
Whatever else she may be, Rhaena remains the blood of the dragon, and my
sister, whom I love.” His Grace did not take issue with Lord Smallwood’s
point, it should be noted, only with his words.

I have a tiny issue with all the above. Yes, what Barth said is right from one perspective. Veiled hostility is better than open hostility. But there is one other view to consider as well. A ruler should always be seen as powerful, should be feared as well as respected. If someone is openly threatening/disparaging a ruler like Smallwood talked of cutting Rhaena's tongue or when Farman says they will boot out Areara physically the way they did Rhaena. An image of power is as important as power. In such a case, where the the ruler's image of power is being weakened, isn't the ruler supposed to put the subject in his place?

Barth says ""show that dragon"", that it will suffice. Well, Rhaena has travelled to Fair Isle on dragon. Everyone knows Targaryens had dragons, what else would be needed to give a hint that treat us with due respect?

Also  while the above happened sometime early 56 AC presumably, we get to know that Lord Smallwood was dismissed as Hand around a year later. Although Gyldane judiciously notes that Jahaerys didn't take any action against Smallwood when he talked of cutting Rhaena's tongue. 

&gt;Returning once again to 57 AC, that was also the year wherein Jaehaerys
dismissed Lord Myles Smallwood as Hand of the King. Though undoubtedly
a leal man, and well-intentioned, his lordship had shown himself to be illsuited
to the small council. As he himself would say, “I was made to sit a
horse, not a cushion.”


At the same time, we do see Smallwood give some seriously foolish advice to Jahaerys. For example, when Smallwood advised Jahaerys to declare war on Pentos because the outlaws in Andalos in the neighbourhood of Pentos had killed Jahaerys' men who had gone searching for Balerion. 

&gt; “There is no monster,” Septon Barth concluded after hearing the sad tale,
“only men stealing sheep, and telling tales to frighten other men away.”
Myles Smallwood, the King’s Hand, urged the king to punish Pentos for the
outrage, but Jaehaerys was unwilling to make war upon an entire city for the
crimes of some outlaws.

0,1,0,9,7,"I always thought it would have made mores sense for Robert to have married a Reach woman (maybe one of the Hightowers or one of Mace's two sisters). In real life historical situations, it wasn't unusual for 'warring' factions, and not just allies, to bind together through marriage. 

While Tywin's men are in the Red Keep, there are enough Baratheon loyalists to get them out—and at this point, Dorne sure as hell wouldn't join in with the Lannisters if Tywin decides to declare war on Robert if he refuses to marry Cersei and the Reach wouldn't, either. Promise Tywin to release Jaime from his vows and for his first granddaughter to be Queen (maybe even arrange a marriage for Cersei to Edmure) in exchange for turning over the Mountain and Trant to Dorne in an attempt to make amends, and Tywin would have been satisfied imo. It also would have soothed Dorne somewhat. Plus, the Reach has enough grains and money (they are the second wealthiest region) to help rebuild Westeros.  

With this alliance, Robert's power bloc is the Reach + the Stormlands + Riverlands + Vale + North + the Westerlands, strong enough to easily overcome Dorne and the Crownlands if they choose to rebel. And if the Westerlands splinters off, Dorne will never join them—Elia and her children's death is a barrier between the two possible 'trouble' reasons that can never be completely fixed.  The powerbloc could even be further cemented by marrying Sansa to Willas and Marg to Jaime's heir.  

Other marriage alliances would have been Cersei over Elia and Jaime and Cat. The most eligible women who follow the seven would have been Alerie Hightower, Cersei, Elia, and Catelyn, and while all of them would have been good choices, Cersei would have been his best bet if he was worried about his father/his reign because of the power of the Westerlands.  That said, considering he crowned Lyanna before he even knew Elia couldn't have a third kid, I suspect Rhaegar would have pulled the same stunt on Cersei except she would have found a way for both him and Lyanna to die in an 'accident.' Cat's around the same age as Jaime, maybe a year or two older, more beautiful and smarter than Lysa, and from a agricultural rich region that borders the Westerlands. I never understood why Hoster didn't try and offer Cat for Jaime, to offer the wealthiest region his 'best' daughter (as cruel as that sounds).

0,1,0,16,19,"What happened to Aerea was pretty mysterious, disgusting and at the same time engrossing. 

House Targaryen wasn't even considered a strong house in Valyria, so it makes you wonder about the kind of dragons and magic the strongest households had or maybe their bloodlines were even stronger than Targaryen blood? for instance, Targaryen's are mostly resistant to illnesses, so it's not too unlikely that the stronger houses had more benefits to their bloodlines as they also interbred to keep the line pure.

While rare, it is possible for women to carry twins with different fathers, provided they had sex with the father's in rapid succession and that the twins are fraternal.

0,1,0,8,3,"Lately, there have been many discussions regarding the mysterious House Reed and its mysterious lord, Howland.

Mainly, people have been trying to figure out why he seemingly doesn't give a damn about anything happening in Westeros since at least ACoK, and arguably, since the beginning of the series. This is especially odd considering how close we are led to believe he was with Eddard Stark.

Throughout the story, we have very little word from within Greywater Watch. In fact, the *only* representatives of Greywater Watch in the entire main series are Meera and Jojen, and seemingly no one back at home cares where they went or what they are doing. And they've been gone for at least a year, perhaps closer to two.

To me, the explanation that makes the most sense for these two points is that Howland Reed got sick and subsequently died sometime between when he last spoke to Ned and when Jojen and Meera arrive to swear fealty to Bran at Winterfell. I think it is possible that he knew he was dying, and he ordered his castle to keep quiet so as not to jeopardize/complicate any possible war-related battle or travel plans Robb may have had involving the Neck.

This would in turn, make Jojen (or possibly Meera) the current ruler of Greywater Watch, which is why Howland hasn't sent anyone to track down where his children have been for almost two years.

If Howland did die and Greywater Watch did announce it, it would only lead to much more fighting and military occupation in the Neck so as to prevent Robb's army from traversing as easily en route to the South and the eventual Battle of Oxcross. I believe armies would be eager to attempt to invade the Neck while they are being ruled by two children. If we are to believe the Howland is also capable of greensight, it is possible he saw Robb's victories and knew Robb's safe crossing of the Neck would be crucial to his chances of victory.

Furthermore, it would also explain why House Reed has done literally nothing since the war broke out, because Howland is dead and the rightful heirs are with Bran North of the Wall and consider his journey to be far more important than the recent events. 

You could even make the case that the reason Meera and Jojen are so invested in helping Bran fully unlock his Greensight abilities is so that he can eventually prove (somehow) that Jon is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and subsequently has a strong (perhaps the strongest) claim to the Iron Throne. Think about it. Why else would the Reed children care that much about Bran unlocking his greensight? It's much more in the nature of the crannogmen to carefully plan an easier end to the war rather than charging right into battle.

Anyway, feel free to let me know in the comments if I've overlooked any major details that would flat-out disprove this, or add any details that could relate to this theory one way or the other.",1,(Spoilers Extended) Possible Howland Reed Theory,2886,48
0,1,0,9,10,"I really enjoyed the latest Fire and Blood release but sometimes I get somewhat emotionally exhausted. I have to put the book down and just do something else for an hour or two.


Don't get me wrong its really good in my personal opinion and I have gotten attached to some characters and grown to love hating others. I felt Alysannes sorrow when her first daughter died. I got creeped out when Aerea returned. I got sad when Baelon and Aemon bit it.... but my only major gripe is there's just so much rape. Way too much rape. Its everywhere.


I know GRRM tries to be realistic and portrays the brutal realities of being a woman in a feudalistic world but Jesus sometimes its too much for me.



Take the sack of Tumbleton for example. GRRM basically wrote it comparable to the rape of Nanking. Septas were raped, women and girls as young as 8 or 9 as well sometimes over a hundred times by A hundred people. Babies were even speared etc. It's just awful all around.


Then you have the noble family in Tumbleton. Lord Roxton basically kills Lord Footly and rapes his wife over her husband's corpse. Then keeps her  basically a sex slave until he kills Hugh the Hammer and gets murdered. WOIAF portrays him as this noble bad ass with cool last words but in reality the guy is just an ugly power hungry rapist tool who secretly wanted to be a dragon rider and eliminate competition.


Lady Footly gives birth to a kid a year later and swears its actually her husband's son and heir but everyone can tell its Roxtons kid. It's just awful all around.


It's still a great book with lots of good content. Hour of the Wolf still made me smile. Oakenfist remained awesome. The political intrigues of Aegons regency was fun to read about even if it got brutal at times but yeah the rapes in this book are too much to handle and almost makes me stop from reading.

0,1,0,84,15,"With all the talk of *Fire &amp; Blood* and in-universe chronicles of in-universe history, I thought it'd be fun to talk about an absolute legend at the Citadel: Archmaester Walgrave.

Who the hell is Walgrave? 

In AFFC's prologue, we are introduced to Walgrave as the doddering, senile Archmaester in charge of ravenry. Pate the novice is an aide to Walgrave, and steals his archmaester's key to give to the Alchemist/Jaqen H'ghar. Later in the book, Walgrave is chosen for position of Seneschal of the Citadel, but due to his age and senility, Archmaester Theobald performs the duties on Walgraves' behalf.

Yet before Walgrave was a tottering old coot, he was a heck of a guy. For one thing, he taught a certain young orphan, one Yandel, how to read, setting Yandel on the course to publishing The World of Ice and Fire. He often calls Pate by Cressen's name, suggesting that he once mentored Maester Cressen, who went on to serve the Baratheons at Storm's End (later at Dragonstone). 

Interestingly, when Pate steals the key, he sees a few other ~~plot hooks~~ trinkets in Walgrave's strongbox. These include: 

- A bag of silver stags
- A lock of yellow hair tied up in a ribbon
- A painted miniature of a woman who resembles Walgrave (even his mustache)
- A lobstered steel knight's gauntlet that supposedly once belonged to a prince

One last mystery intrigues the reader. We are told in ADWD of Maester Walys, the Maester at Winterfell during Rickard Stark's rule. Barbrey Dustin suspects Walys, the grey rat, of being responsible for the Southron Ambitions plot. Maester Walys is the bastard son of a ""Hightower girl"" and an ""archmaester of the Citadel."" Given Walgrave's age, and the similarity of their names, many suspect that Walgrave was Walys' father. 

So, a few open questions:

- What's up with the portrait of the woman who resembles Walgrave? A sister, a mother, a sister-lover? 

- What connections does Walgrave have to the Southron Ambitions plot? We know he was connected to Robert Baratheon's Maester, Cressen; he may have also been connected to Rickard Stark's Maester, Walys. 

- What's up with the gauntlet in Walgrave's box? What prince wore that armor, and what was their connection to Walgrave?

This is especially true for large masses of ice such as the wall which is seven hundred feet tall. This little fact does violence to the idea that giants and mammoths were dragging around mighty blocks of ice then winching them several hundred feet in the air to stack on top of other ice blocks. That idea itself raises other questions on the logistical issues involved in such a feat i.e. transporting the blocks through the mountainous regions of the west.

I would imagine that the wall might not be entirely made of ice but rather it consists of a stone core, around which ice has been heaped so that only the outermost part of the wall is ice although, one would still need to account for how the bottom parts of this outer layer haven't yet buckled and melted under the enormous weight exerted on them by the rest of the ice, so that theory isn't very appealing. I also don't want to consider the idea that that whoever envisaged such a wall was not exactly familiar with the physical properties of ice.

I actually believe these creatures are not just fyrewyrms but in fact human-fyrewyrms. Basically the product of breeding a firewyrm with a human. The Valyrians often conducted such (human-beast) experiments on slave women, etc as noted in TWOIAF.   
  
Now, I'm not sure if these wyrms were born inside of her body or were there before she entered Valyria.  
But seeing that they were so tiny and fragile (they died when they touched the icy water), I tend to think that an adult Firewyrm impregnated Aerea (or Rhaella?) and these little creatures were born.

What was odd to me on this re-read was the part of the chapter where he starts thinking about the kings he has served, and how by saving Aerys he might have condemned Rhaegar.

While Barristan is thinking about how Rhaegar would have made a great king that could have healed the realm, and about Ellia and Aegon, along with Rhaenys would be alive and well... it struck me as weird.

Rhaegar himself said goodbye to the last royal guard in KL (Jaime), and he took Selmy with him to the battle on the trident: how could Selmy not think of Lyanna Stark in all of this?

Isn’t odd that Selmy would think of all these other dead but never spare Lyanna a thought? Especially since Lyanna was the reason Robert ended up killing Rhaegar.

0,1,0,53,145,"Reading Fire &amp; Blood, about 300 pages in, and I want to know everything about the ship Sun Chaser that sailed west in the reign of Jaehaerys I and was never seen again...unless it was, in Asshai-by-the-Shadow years later, by Corlys Velaryon, the first Westerosi to make it that far. Here's what we know, as far as I can tell:

—The ship is captained by ""Alys Westhill""

—""Alys Westhill"" is actually Lady Elissa Farman, close friend of Rhaena Targaryen until the two had a falling out on Dragonstone, at which point Lady Elissa absconded with three dragon's eggs (Daenerys' eggs? probably?) and set out for Essos, where she sold the eggs somewhere in order to build her ship, Sun Chaser.

—Her dream is to sail west, where nobody has dared sail before, into the unknown. 

—The fact that she stole dragon's eggs is a huge deal to Jaehaerys I, who tried to hunt her down via any means necessary, and almost caught her before she sailed out of Oldtown. In the process of trying to get the eggs back, Septon Barth managed to get the Iron Bank to forgive a huge chunk (the remainder, I think) of the realm's debt, which allowed Jaehaerys to rebuild King's Landing and eventually build roads and etc.

—Sun Chaser left Oldtown with two other ships, Lady Meredith (captained by Eustace Hightower) and Autumn Moon (captained by his brother, whose name I can't find at the moment), the latter of which sunk (perhaps aided by a kraken) and the former of which staggered around the Summer Isles and Sothoryos for three years before making it back to King's Landing.

—Sun Chaser found three small islands further to the west than anyone had sailed before, but disagreement between Alys Westhill and Eustace Hightower split them up for good, with the Sun Chaser continuing west.

—Many years later, the famous sailor Corlys Velaryon claimed to have seen Sun Chaser in Asshai, which, if true, means that the ship (if not necessarily all its occupants) circumnavigated the globe.

What did they see in between Westeros and Asshai, if anything? It's all so intriguing, and I want to know so much more.

The one where we spent a feverish night thinking that some sort of TWOW announcement was imminent, and instead we got nothing -- and we still haven't got an answer to what this cryptic post was about.

For a while, the leading (and most convincing) theory was this was simply a tease for a 'Doom of Valyria' chapter in Fire and Blood Vol 1. Yet, that has been blown out of the water because Fire and Blood is sadly lacking in a 'Doom' chapter or any substantial information about Valyria (except what happened to Aerea Targaryen...)

So what do we think now? Here are the possible options:

* George was indeed referring to TWOW, perhaps this foreshadows a 'Doom of Oldtown' chapter caused by Euron in the next book... especially since the post includes the Greyjoy avatar for no discernable reason.

* George was referring to the spin-off about the Doom of Valyria. I am less inclined towards this one because a) the Greyjoy avatar makes no sense and b) the tag is firmly #a song of ice and fire and not #game of thrones

* George, maybe, was writing about Aerea Targaryen and what happened to her and has some sort of meaning/foreshadowing for Dany's journey in TWOW or ADOS?

Basically, Andalos is the Holy Land for the Faith, the place where gods walked among humans. Now, Andals migrated to Westeros and left Andalos behind, probably to save themselves from the rising power of Valyria. However, Valyria eventually fell. I wonder: did any High Septon or any particularly pious king want to reclaim Andalos for the Seven? Were there any planned expeditions to retake this holy land after Valyria fell?

0,1,0,59,0,"In Fire and Blood we learn of Coryanne Wylde an noble girl who fell pregnant with a bastard, from a stable boy, at 13. and supposedly wrote the book ""A Caution for Young Girls""

Shortly after giving birth,she is sent to an inn, where she is made to dissrobe, and is inspected by a Bratheon Lord, perhaps the Hand of the King Lord Roger himself. After the inspection, it is decided she is to become one of Queen Alysanne's handmaids.

However this doesnt make sense, why would a disgraced 15-16 year old become the handmaiden of a 13 year old queen of the seven kingdoms?

&gt;Mayhaps. Yet there are certain things that we do know beyond a doubt that may allow us to draw our own conclusions. **We do know that the younger daughter of Morgan Wylde, Lord of the Rain House, was deflowered at an early age and gave birth to a bastard boy. We can be reasonably certain that Lord Rogar knew of her shame; not only was he Lord Morgan’s liege, but the child was placed in his own household.** We know that Coryanne Wylde was amongst the maids who were sent to Dragonstone as companions for **Queen Alysanne…a singularly curious choice, if a lady-in-waiting was all she was meant to be, for scores of other young girls of noble birth and suitable age were also available, girls whose maidenheads were intact and whose virtue was beyond reproach.**

&gt;“Why her?” many have asked in the years since. Did she have some special gift, some particular charm? If so, no one remarked on it at the time. Could Lord Rogar or Queen Alyssa have been indebted to her lord father or lady mother for some past favor or kindness? We have no record of it. No plausible explanation for the selection of Coryanne Wylde has ever been offered, save for the simple, ugly answer proferred by **A Caution for Young Girls: she was sent to Dragonstone not for Alysanne, but for Jaehaerys.**


Even though Alysanne and Jaehaerys marriage were supposedly not immediately consumated, the serving folk of the castle spoke of them sharing long kisses, and lying in bed naked with eachother.


So it pretty clear Jaehaerys liked young girls, where am i going with this you ask?  Jaehaerys, daughters Viserra, Saera, and Gael.


By 14 Saera had been excited to become betrothed, however by the time she was 16 Jaehaerys had still made no move to betrothe her

Eventualy Saera starts spending with new friends, a trio of boys, and two girls. 

&gt;Jaehaerys remained unconcerned. “It is not as if Saera were ever alone with any of them. There are always people about, serving men and maids, grooms and men-at-arms. What mischief can they get up to with so many eyes around them?”

Eventually their group begins to have sex. Once news of Saera's adventures get out we have this exchange.

“What have you done?” the king said, when at last the princess ran out of words. “*Seven save us, what have you done*? Have you given one of these boys your maidenhead? Tell me true.” 

&gt;**“True?” said Saera. It was in that moment, with that word, that the contempt came out. “No. I gave it to all three. They all think they were the first. Boys are such silly fools.”**

Saera had no real opportunity to sleep with anyone before the tro of boys, that sudden turn to contempt in her paint a dark picture, no man had the opportunity to lay with her before hand, no man but Jaehaerys himself...

&gt;She had gone too far. Jaehaerys rose to his feet and descended from the Iron Throne, his face a mask of rage. “You would compare yourself to Maegor? Is that who you aspire to be?” His Grace had heard enough. “Take her back to her bedchamber,” he told his guards, “**and keep her there until I send for her again**.” 
.
&gt;When the princess heard his words, she rushed toward him, crying, “Father, Father!” but Jaehaerys turned his back on her, and Gyles Morrigen caught her by the arm and wrenched her away. She would not go of her own accord, so the guards were forced to drag her from the hall, wailing and sobbing and calling for her father.

At this point Saera is terrifired, she begs, not to her sympathetic mother for leanincy, but to Jaehaerys, terrified of what he will do to her.

By the time Saera escapes to Essos and the pillowhouse, this is is Jaehaerys' stance

&gt;“They have made our daughter into a whore,” she said. **“She always was,”** the king replied.

Those are not the words of a father. But if a jilted ""lover"" of an abuser

Following Saera, we have Gael, who is supposedly seduced and a abandoned by her her lover after she is with child, even though the court should have taken ample precautions after Saera.

following a still birth Gael throws herself into the black water and dies.

Fast forward a few decades and a senile Jaehaerys begins to confuse Alicent Hightower, a young girl at the time, who *reads* to him for hours at a time, with Saera. Jaehaerys dies during a *reading* session

However, logistically, this has a lot of holes and begs many questions, such as: 

* Why, if Varys and Illyrio were hoping for a Targaryen invasion, did they turn to the one culture/tribe in Essos that is terrified of water and lacks the resources (namely ships) to cross the Narrow Sea? Why not sell Dany to, say, a Triarch or a very wealthy merchant/prince with dreams of conquering the Seven Kingdoms?

* Disposing of Viserys was a necessity, but why get rid of Dany and three valuable dragon eggs when both of those could've lent Aegon a much needed credibility? (Instead of just showing up alone with no evidence of being Rhaegar's son, he would've showed up alongside another Targ and with three dragon eggs, which is a vast improvement in terms of optics)

* But why, if the original plan was for the Golden Company to join Viserys and the Dothraki, did Illyrio all but imply that he got Viserys to get himself killed? For that matter, he says he never expected Dany to survive much longer either. So was he playing the Golden Company and never intended for Viserys to survive and invade? But if so, that contradicts his dialogue with Varys in AGOT where he specifically says that they need to wait for Khal Drogo to ""bestir himself."" So...was Illyrio lying to Varys there? 

* And if the original plan was for Aegon to defeat both the Dothraki *and* the Golden Company, how the hell was Aegon supposed to do that? And why would the GC fight *against* a Blackfyre (if Aegon's indeed a Blackfyre) alongside the Targaryens? Were they supposed to switch sides at a pivotal moment and break the most important rule of the GC (""our word is as good as gold"")?

With all these convoluted questions and the beginning of a thundering headache, this is one conclusion I've reached to try and make sense of all this mess: 

Illyrio is lying to Varys. The latter seemed to think the plan about the Targs invading was a go, but Illyrio made everything in his power to prevent it. In fact, it now occurs to me that maybe the reason why Illyrio kept saying they weren't ready yet in AGOT was because he was stalling, waiting for Dany and Viserys to die. It seems to me that Illyrio was never a fan of any plan involving Dany and Viserys, while Varys was, for what reason I can't say. Perhaps he rightfully thought it was a stupid ass plan that would've likely resulted on Aegon getting disemboweled by an angry Dothraki screamer. I dunno, that's the only explanation I can come up with.

* Aegon IV attacks Dorne with wooden dragon full of wildfire, it ends terribly. I guess this counts as a Dornish War.

So to me there are 6 Dornish Wars. Did I forget something ?

0,1,0,25,16,"I won't go into the discussion of Dany's eggs most likely being the one that Elissa stole and sold to the Iron Bank. 

Anyways when Jahaerys realizes that those eggs are with the Sealord, he sends Septon Barth to get those eggs back from the Sealord. There is this whole page long drama about Jahaerys sending veiled threats to burn Braavos if they don't give the eggs back. The Sealord refuses saying Jahaerys has no right to ask them back unless Braavos succeeds in hatching those dragon eggs. And instead waives off loan in return for the dragon eggs. 

&gt; “You cannot prove elsewise. If I did have them, however…well, until they hatch, they are but stones. Would your king begrudge me three pretty stones? Now, if I had three…chickens…I might understand his concern.

Sealord talking of hatching of chicken reminded me of all the theories surrounding Euron selling a dragon egg to the Faceless Men and the Faceless Men themselves sending Jaqen to the Citadel in the hopes of finding means to hatch it. I am guessing if Dany's dragon eggs indeed were with the Sealords upto a point of time, they must be bitterly ruing parting with it. And hence their quest with hatching this new egg. Whether they ultimately succeed or not, the eggs Jahaerys was speaking of definitely hatched. And  Jahaerys (past alter-ego of Jon) says this if the eggs hatch:

&gt; “The Sealord had best hope that they remain stones,” Jaehaerys said. “If I should hear so much as a whisper of…chickens…his palace will be the first to burn.”

Jon most likely is riding one of those same hatched chicken which Jahaerys was afraid of, the one named after his father. And then we have this conversation between Jahaerys and Rhaena. Jahaerys is not going alone. 

**Rhaena accompanies Jahaerys to Braavos**

&gt; They were stolen from us, they are ours by right. If that demand should be denied, then we must needs go and get them. Take them back if we can, kill them if not. No hatchlings can hope to stand against Vermithor and Dreamfyre.”

&gt;“And Silverwing?” asked Rhaena. “Our sister—”

&gt;“—had no part in this. I will not put her at risk.”

By itself, this doesn't clarify much. Who is supposed to be Rhaena here? But when taken together with the distinct connections between Rhaena and Arya. 

Rhaena is married to the cruelest of men, and there are rumors of Rhaena using the knife on Maegor on her wedding night. This reminded me of Jon thinking that Arya will stab Ramsay if he forces her to consummate their marriage. 


&gt; Many queer and contradictory stories are told of the night that followed the wedding...Did Princess Rhaena attempt to kill the king with a dagger concealed beneath her pillows, as she later claimed? 

&gt; Would she still have that little sword he'd had Mikken forge for her? Stick them with the pointy end, he'd told her. Wisdom for her wedding night if half of what he heard of Ramsay Snow was true.

Second, all the parallels between the end days of Maegor/Cersei and how he is killled. 

&gt; There were even some who whispered that it was Queen Rhaena who had somehow contrived to free the realm from Maegor the Cruel...Maegor was alive when Rosby and Towers left the throne room, they argue, and the guards at the doors swore that no one entered afterward, until Queen Elinor made her discovery. Some say it was the queen herself who forced him down onto those barbs and blades, to avenge the murder of her first husband. The Kingsguard might have done the deed, though that would have required them to act in concert, as there were two knights posted at each door. It might also have been a person or persons unknown, entering and leaving the throne room through some hidden passage. The Red Keep has its secrets, known only to the dead.

In his end days, Maegor is completely isolated by the realm because of his cruelty, the Poor Fellows and Warrior Sons rise against him once again, all the Lords have turned against him. And there are rumors of him being killed by a Kingsguard or Rhaena or someone who has entered the throne room through the hidden passages. 

Cersei already has the Faith against her, no doubt the Poor Fellows and Warrior Sons are soon to follow. Most expect her isolated at the end, killed by a Kingsguard (Jaime) or by Arya (who is well-versed with the hidden passages and who is training in the arts of Faceless Men, who are masters of stealth assassinations so that it  looks like the victim killed themselves/).

After the death of Areare, Rhaena spends her end days at Harrenhal. The character whom we have spend almost an entire book at Harrenhal after the death of her father is Arya. And we have a very pointed reminder that Rhaena is *not* Nymeria by Rogar Baratheon. 

&gt; ""Rhaena is not Nymeria.” 

But most importantly the fact that Arya is obviously the one who is most associated with Braavos and Faceless Men. The fact that many a theories have been written that [compare Arya with the first Faceless Man who began it all.](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/133891-the-valkyrie-of-the-fm-theory-about-the-first-and-the-first-reborn/). The fact that Arya and Sansa share quite a few parallels, and if Sansa killed her mentor, will Arya be far behind? Particularly if in the end it turns out that  the Iron Bank had been manipulating Westerosi politics for a long time using Faceless Men, creating turmoil during peace, pitting one ruler against the other, in the hopes that more are forced to turn to the Iron Bank. In such a case, doesn't it thematically require that the controls of Iron Bank over the society is ended and that means the end of Faceless Men. Arya may not be the first Faceless Man to begin it all, but what if she is the last one to end it all? 

The Faceless Men began as a response to the slavery by the Valyrians, in this case, the Valyrians themselves have ended the slavery. Thereby bringing an end to the thematic requirement of Faceless Men, who have long overstayed their welcome. 

So are Jahaerys and Rhaena (aka Jon and Arya) together conquering Braavos and bringing an end to the Sealord/Iron Bank/Faceless Men nexus? I don't know if anyone has paid attention to this, but Braavos is sinking, just like Volantis. So much so that almost an entire section of it is half drowned and named as such.

&gt; Another harbor, more distant, was off to her left, beyond a sinking point of land where the tops of half-drowned buildings thrust themselves above the water....The Drowned Town is the eldest part of the city. It is located in an area in the north-west of the city, directly north of the Ragman's Harbor, where the town has fallen into the lagoon and only the domes and towers of the old buildings are visible above the surface of the water.

Further tinfoil. Will this attack happen because the Faceless Men kill or try to kill someone close to Jon or Arya or maybe even them? 

&gt; There are certain things that we might do to your king as well, however....
However, there is in this city a certain…guild, let us say…whose members are very skilled at their chosen profession. They could not destroy King’s Landing, nor fill its streets with corpses. But they could kill…a few. A well-chosen few.”

___________________________________________________________________

##Rebirth Of Valyria

Kind of seems odd , just conquering this odd Essosi city! Some further speculations of mine which I think that F&amp;B corroborated (obviously I am biased in this). In the same episode where what were to become Dany's dragon eggs disappeared (that whole episode looks chalk-full of foreshadowings!), Jahaerys also says the following: 

&gt; I will not allow Valyria to rise again. Imagine what the triarchs of Volantis would do with dragons. Let us pray it never comes to that.” 

 Except we already are reasonably sure the eventual ruler of Volantis (Dany) in a turn of fate gets the same chicken, erm, dragons. Will Valyrian Empire rise again?

Again concurrent to the same episode, where the dragon eggs and Balerion disappeared, and Jahaerys sends envoys to find Balerion, there are 3 rumors of Balerion the Dread's sightings:

&gt; One report spoke of a dragon being displayed in the fighting pits of **Astapor on Slaver’s Bay**,....The most intriguing report came from the hills of **Andalos north of Pentos**, where shepherds spoke in fearful tones of a monster on the prowl, devouring entire flocks and leaving only bloody bones behind. ......Of far more interest to the king and council was the great fire that had swept across the **Disputed Lands** a fortnight past...engulfing half a dozen villages and one free company, the Adventurers, who found themselves trapped between the onrushing flames and a Tyroshi host under the command of the Archon himself.

Balerion's path matches well with the speculations that the Quarrelsome sisters will unite, led by Tyrosh, to bring down the anti-slavery force i.e. Dany in the Disputed Lands. And that Barristan's deal with Windblown or perhaps Illyrio's deceit doesn't bode well for Pentos. F&amp;B just reconfirmed that [whole of Dothraki Sea, Whole of Slaver's Bay, Volantis, Lys, Myr, Tyrosh and Stepstones all in the end paying allegiance to a single Valyrian force.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9y13vn/spoilers_extended_danys_conquest_of_essos_a_step/e9yhhqj/) The link above and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9y13vn/spoilers_extended_danys_conquest_of_essos_a_step/) goes into some depth (although doesn't cover everything) into the scores of foreshadowings and parallels 
which cement the conquest of each of the above regions and cities. 

I am unsure whether Dany's route takes her to Qohor and Norvos or whether they stay out of the orbit. Qohor featured quite prominently in AGOT Dany's arc and Norvos looks to be stealthily entering the story with Mellario and now Andrey Dalt reaching over there. Qarth on the other hand has already engaged against Dany in ADWD blockading Mereen with its ships, creating food and resource paucity for her people. The Sorrowful Men have already tried to kill Dany once, even after she left Qarth. And the Tourmaline Brotherhood is full of corsairs, whose biggest source of revenue is selling slaves. I am guessing the reason we saw Euron in Qarth is that he is part of the same Tourmaline Brotherhood. While all the above makes it imperative that the Qarth-Dany conflict comes to a head at some point, Qarth is quite isolated from the rest of Dany's path. Is Dany-Qarth conflict resolved in an off-screen scene in Qarth or somewhere else? Does it get resolved with Euron's death in Westeros? I don't know. 

**Circle Of Time**


The only regions and cities which will definitely not be a part of this new anti-slavery Valyrian Empire are Braavos and Lorath, *until Jahaerys and Rhaena bring them into the Valyrian fold.* This is a circle of time. The Valyrian Empire end resulted in rise of the masters of Slaver's Bay, resulted in the rise of sellsword companies and the creation of Disputed Lands, resulted in rise of Braavos, resulted in the Dothraki becoming the biggest menace. And the fall of the masters, the sellsword companies, the Iron Bank and the taming of the Dothraki will accompany the re-birth of the Valyrian Empire.

**Rebuilding the Bridge**

And this time, the Valyrian Empire will unite whole of Essos, as well as Westeros. The unification of Westeros and Essos which were broken apart  by the children (if you didn't realize till now, Martin hates borders. And the children created two of the biggest - the Wall and the Arm) will symbolically [begin with Dany's conquest of the Stepstones.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9y13vn/spoilers_extended_danys_conquest_of_essos_a_step/e9yhhqj/) The stepstones being the hotbed of pirates who carry off hapless passengers to become slaves, Daemon's (with whom Dany shares quite a few parallels)  sole title being the King of Stepstones, the power dispute over Stepstones being the cause of many a war between the Triarchy, and between Triarchy and Westeros, all make it imperative that Stepstones serve as the bridging gap rather than as the divide between Essos and Westeros. And this means they become a part of the same Valyrian Empire. Just like Martin made it almost explicit from quotes about Aegon the Conqueror that Westeros is not ending divided, rather united; even Westeros itself will be united with Essos. 

The Essosi arc is not ending in chaos and mayhem, it is ending in the achievement of Martin's vision- Terra. 

&gt;“I’d read Robert Heinlein. The early Heinlein — he later became nationalistic — was convinced that sooner or later we were going to destroy ourselves with atomic bombs unless we formed a world government and we all came together. You look back on the science fiction that I grew up with, and of that period, and that unspoken assumption is everywhere....You grow up reading that stuff and you start to think of yourself as an earthman, as a Terran, not as an American, or a Californian.”

&gt;"" In people like Heinlein, with the one-worlders, there was just this unspoken assumption that there’s two ways that we’re going to go as the human race: completely going to destroy ourselves with atomic bombs, or we’re going to somehow overcome our difficulties. 



**TLDR: Essos and Westeros are becoming Terra, one world,  united in a new anti-slavery Valyrian Empire. Jahaerys this time will welcome the Valyrian Empire. And Braavos will be the last city to be brought into its fold.**",1,(Spoilers Extended) The chickens hatched..is Jahaerys burning the Sealord's Palace?,13524,83

0,1,0,139,1063,"Okay, so I want to address something I find very interesting, and that is George RR. Martin's feelings for the two characters Bran and Arya, and how it may be proof the series will sadly never be finished.



It's no secret that Martin doesn't really like Bran. He has said that Bran is the hardest character to write for, and he famously forgot to include Bran in Jon's opening 'A Game of Thrones' chapter, as well as the letter to the fans at the end of 'Feast.' However Bran is the character that began this whole adventure, it was his chapter that first came into Martin's head beginning this epic. So why would Martin dislike him??



Now lets contrast this with Arya. Martin has said Arya is his favourite character, second only to Tyrion. And he has written a bucket load of chapters for her (34). In fact she has the third most chapters in the series, behind Tyrion(49) and Jon(42). Ahead of Dany(31), and way ahead of Sansa(25) and of course Bran(21).



So why the stark contrast for these two characters who most fans would agree have similar importance? 



Martin has said the first reason that Bran is hard to write for is that he is the youngest POV, making getting inside his head difficult. Although I find this a little hard to believe. Arya is not much older than Bran really, and on top of that she is Martin's opposite gender. Bran is very similar to many Martin protagonists in other novels and probably similar to a young Martin himself. Shy, reclusive, lovesick dreamer who wants to do right by the world, but is battling his own selfishness. 
Meanwhile Arya is a young rebellious girl, fighting the norms and expectations of her status, gender and age. In terms of getting inside their heads, Arya should clearly be much harder for Martin.
The second reason Martin has said that Bran is hard to write for really cuts to the heart of it in my opinion. Bran's storyline is what Martin finds tricky. Bran's story is linked to the growing magic in the world, the bigger picture, the end game. Martin knows that he has to craft Bran's arc carefully. 



Okay Bran's chapters are harder to write, but why does that mean he should get so much less than Arya?



Clearly writing for Arya is a lot more fun for Martin. Arya goes on adventures all across Westeros and over to Essos. She runs into countless minor characters, all with interesting back stories and personalities. She's there for Ned's beheading, she's there for the Red Wedding. She even runs into Sam in Bravos for seemingly no reason other than a cool easter egg. 



So what has this got to do with the finishing of the overall story?? Well Martin has specifically stated that he doesn't outline his novels because if he knows where a story is going he loses all interest in it. Couple this with how 'Feast' and 'Dance' turned out. They weren't books that helped bring this story to its finale. They expanded the story, adding many characters, locations and general world-building. In a lot of ways, they weren't really sequels to 'A Storm of Swords,' but spin offs. Then instead of the next book we get a full blown publication of world building notes, 'Fire and Blood' 



Martin loves writing about Arya's adventures, because he is discovering and creating the world along with her. With Bran, its not the world, its the story. A story that he can only possibly write if he knows where its going. Something that bores him. So why waste time on boring Bran? Bran, who reminds us all and likely Martin himself, of our own inability to achieve the greatness our potential could bestow. No way, lets go on another adventure with Arya.    



And so its the same with the series. Instead of writing the next book and fulfilling his destiny, Martin would rather discover other aspects of his world, things that he has never thought of before, things that are fresh and exciting. Hence why 'Fire and Blood' has come out instead of the next actual book in the series. And hence why Martin may never find the spark he needs to complete something that likely no longer, truly holds his interest.

Robb did the exact opposite: he took South the able-bodied, the young and the vigorous men who were needed in the fields. In ADWD Alys Karstark famously says that there weren't enough men left in Karhold to properly reap the crops.

0,1,0,65,140,"In my opinion, the most striking story in F&amp;B has been the story of Aerea Targaryen. She lived her first 11 years being shuffled around Westeros as a sort of hostage/ward, but somehow was able to form a bond with Balerion The Black Dread, the mightiest of all dragons. The two then disappear for a year, before they return to Westeros

&gt;landing in the courtyard of the Red Keep one day that would long be remembered. Aerea was afflicted with something that neither the Grand Maester nor Septon Barth had ever seen before, a worm-like creature which had been roasting the girl from within. Only plunging her in a bath of freezing water was able to end the creatures, but it killed Aerea also. As worrying as the creatures had been, something else had terrified the court even more: Balerion, the greatest of the Targaryen dragons, had been wounded. The last time Balerion had faced a beast similar to himself in combat had been Quicksilver at the Battle Beneath the God's Eye, and he had made short work of the smaller dragon. 

I find so much of this tale interesting. The girl shares a similar story to Dany. And her name is strikingly similar to Arya. And clearly Balerion cared for the girl, because he kept her safe for over a year, and tried to return her to her home to be saved.

It was hypothesized that Balaerion flew her to Valyria. If so, I believe that this would be the first time anyone in recent history has survived (albeit briefly) after having been there.

If she did spare him, what happened next? I suspect he went into hiding. Stannis may have asked Brienne to lie to help with his plans. Lying may not be honorable, but Brienne would do so if her king asked if of her; especially, if Stannis finally woke up to the realization that Melisandre is not good for him...or Westeros.

That did not seem so long ago to Dany. ""Everywhere?"" she said, disappointed. ""Even in the east?"" Magic had died in the west when the Doom fell on Valyria and the Lands of the Long Summer, and neither spell-forged steel nor stormsingers nor dragons could hold it back, but Dany had always heard that the east was different. It was said that manticores prowled the islands of the Jade Sea, that basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti, that spellsingers, warlocks, and aeromancers practiced their arts openly in Asshai, while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night. Why shouldn't there be dragons too?

&gt; ""It is known,"" Jhiqui agreed, as she poured. (ASOS Daenerys V)

**Not touch the dead**

&gt; ""Khaleesi,"" whispered Irri, ""you must not touch the dead man. It is bad luck to touch the dead.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Unless you killed them yourself."" Jhiqui was bigger-boned than Irri, with wide hips and heavy breasts. ""That is known.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""It is known,"" Irri agreed. (ADWD Daenerys I)

**A khaleesi must have a khal**

&gt; ""Only half a hundred times,"" Dany teased. ""You gave up too easily, my lord. For I must marry, all agree.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""A khaleesi must have a khal,"" said Irri, as she filled the queen's cup once again. ""This is known.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Shall I ask again?"" wondered Xaro. (ADWD Daenerys III)

**Unlucky number thirteen**

&gt; ""Xaro Xhoan Daxos has offered me thirteen galleys,"" she told Irri and Jhiqui as they were dressing her for court.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Thirteen is a bad number, Khaleesi,"" murmured Jhiqui, in the Dothraki tongue. ""It is known.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""It is known,"" Irri agreed. (ADWD Daenerys III)

**Cannibalism**

&gt; ""Man must not eat the flesh of man,"" said Aggo.
&gt; 
&gt; ""It is known,"" agreed Rahkaro. ""They will be cursed.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""They're past cursing,"" said Symon Stripeback. (ADWD Daenerys VI)

**Not touch the dead 2**

&gt; ""It is not good to touch the dead,"" said Jhogo.
&gt; 
&gt; ""This is known,"" Aggo and Rakharo said, together.
&gt; 
&gt; ""That may be so,"" said Dany, ""but this thing must be done, all the same."" She thought a moment. ""The Unsullied have no fear of corpses. I shall speak to Grey Worm."" (ADWD Daenerys VI)

**Rakharo does not bed with boys or cows**

&gt; When Daenerys returned to her pyramid, sore of limb and sick of heart, she found Missandei reading some old scroll whilst Irri and Jhiqui argued about Rakharo. ""You are too skinny for him,"" Jhiqui was saying. ""You are almost a boy. Rakharo does not bed with boys. This is known."" Irri bristled back. ""It is known that you are almost a cow. Rakharo does not bed with cows."" (ADWD Daenerys VI)

**Walls 2**

&gt; ""With their hands,"" said Missandei. ""The bricks are old and crumbling. They are trying to claw their way into the city.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""This would take them many years,"" said Irri. ""The walls are very thick. This is known.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""It is known,"" agreed Jhiqui. (ADWD Daenerys VI)

**Belaquo will win and die**

&gt; Hizdahr looked confused. ""There is more to come. A folly, six old women, and three more matches. Belaquo and Goghor!""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Belaquo will win,"" Irri declared. ""It is known.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""It is not known,"" Jhiqui said. ""Belaquo will die."" 
&gt; 
&gt; ""One will die, or the other will,"" said Dany. ""And the one who lives will die some other day. This was a mistake.""(ADWD Daenerys IX)

0,1,0,84,122,"* “Targaryen blood is required to ride dragons” was one of the earliest ideas that GRRM came up with when he decided that ASOIAF should be a fantasy. As the tale grew bigger, problems about this notion started building up. Finally, GRRM seems to have let it go with Fire &amp; Blood.

&gt; I did consider in the very early stages not having the dragons in there. I wanted the Targaryen’s symbol to be the dragons, but I did play with the notion that maybe it was like a psionic power, that it was pyrokinesis — that they could conjure up flames with their minds. I went back and forth. My friend and fellow fantasy writer Phyllis Eisenstein actually was the one who convinced me to put the dragons in, and I dedicated the third book to her. And I think it was the right call.

* Since the beginning, [GRRM was thinking of giving the Targaryens some magic ability](https://winteriscoming.net/2017/08/24/george-r-r-martin-was-initially-against-including-dragons-in-his-novels/), which ended up being able to ride dragons. Obviously, GRRM has some important plans for the current dragons in the story and how they will contribute or who will get to ride them. Otherwise, GRRM would not have introduced them in the first place. But he has to write this “magic” part of the story very carefully as he explains in many interviews.  Magic, when mishandled, can easily ruin a story. (As a side note, I believe that while writing ADwD, the reason why he scrapped the Tyrion chapter where he met the Shrouded Lord was because it ended up being “too much magic” for his taste.)

* The idea that one needs Targaryen blood to ride dragons creates lots of problems some of which I discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/87l9lf/spoilers_extended_do_you_need_targaryen_blood_to/). As the backstory and history of the ASOIAF world expanded, GRRM felt compelled to address these problems. After all, there was a long period that Targaryens bred and ride dragons. He had to make certain decisions about dragon mechanics, even though he would never explain it in the story. (By the way, GRRM still does not seem to address why Gormon Massey or Steffon Darklyn attempted to ride a dragon without having Targaryen ancestry – will he provide them with such by a newly revealed family tree detail?)

* When GRRM announced Fire and Blood Vol. 1, he once again used the [horse analogy](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/8gonxb/spoilers_extended_a_new_comment_from_grrm_about/) in describing dragonriding. This analogy robs the magical aspect of the bond between the dragon and the rider. No doubt, GRRM once thought of a telepathic bond between the dragon and the rider, like a lighter shade of skinchanging. But now, he seems to be treating the dragons as simple horses except the ability to fly and breathe fire (also being far more dangerous). There does not seem anything special with the riders or the bond between them. Skinchanging will remain as special and unique and superior.

* Even then, the idea that only Targaryens can ride dragons is very much rooted among the people in the story. Therefore, if GRRM wants to have some non-Targaryen people riding the current dragons in the story, he still has to come up with solutions. After all, they would never attempt to ride a dragon in the first place if they think that they don’t have the blood requirement. Quentyn did so because he has Targaryen ancestry as he mentioned in the text. The dragonhorn is one such solution where a character without Targaryen ancestry can at least attempt to ride a dragon. GRRM also created the Nettles approach. Tyrion can just do what Nettles did and after seeing some improvement, he can roll the dice, in which case the story is not contaminated with AJT.

* That being said, I think GRRM will still want to keep the illusion that Targaryen blood is required to ride dragons for the people in the story. This brings us to his earliest plans. I think GRRM has been planning since the beginning that Jon will be challenged to ride a dragon to prove his true parentage and he will do it. This will most probably stay as a future plot point from the very end but the circumstances around it might change due to GRRM’s retconning of dragon mechanics.

**SPOILERS FOR FIRE AND BLOOD VOL. 1**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So I’ve finished Fire and Blood Vol. 1 and one of my biggest questions is…

**What the fuck is going on with Alys Rivers?**

She seems to be this strange amalgamation of Shiera Seastar, Bloodraven, Melisandre and Danelle Lothston. Not to mention she's shrouded in mystery.

So I decided to compile a list of quotes relating to this enigma of a woman. Here’s everything we know about her:

**She was a wet nurse at Harrenhal:**

* In addition to the castle, Prince Daemon at a stroke had captured the not-inconsiderable wealth of House Strong and a dozen valuable hostages, amongst them Ser Simon and his grandsons. **The castle smallfolk became his captives as well, amongst them a wet nurse named Alys Rivers.**
* **Though her own children had all been stillborn, the milk that flowed so abundantly from the breasts of Alys Rivers had nourished countless babes born of other women at Harrenhal.**

**She seems to be of bastard birth:**

* **Her name suggests bastard birth … but we know little of her father, and less of her mother.** Munkun and Eustace tell us she was sired by Lord Lyonel Strong in his callow youth, making her a natural half-sister to his sons Harwin (Breakbones) and Larys (the Clubfoot).

**She’s older than she seems:**

* **But Mushroom insists that she was much older, that she was wet nurse to both boys, perhaps even to their father a generation earlier.**
* **Alys Rivers was at least forty years of age during the Dance of the Dragons**, that much is known; Mushroom makes her even older. **All agree that she looked younger than her years**, but whether this was simple happenstance, or achieved through her practice of the dark arts, men continue to dispute.

**There were rumors she practiced magic and the dark arts:**

* Who was this woman? **A serving wench who dabbled in potions and spells, says Munkun. A woods witch, claims Septon Eustace. A malign enchantress who bathed in the blood of virgins to preserve her youth, Mushroom would have us believe.**
* **Was she in truth a witch who lay with demons, bringing forth dead children as payment for the knowledge they gave her?** Was she a simpleminded slattern, as Eustace believes? **A wanton who used her poisons and potions to bind men to her, body and soul?**
* Alys Rivers was at least forty years of age during the Dance of the Dragons, that much is known; Mushroom makes her even older. **All agree that she looked younger than her years, but whether this was simple happenstance, or achieved through her practice of the dark arts**, men continue to dispute.
* Prince Aemond refused to consider this “craven course.” As regent for his brother, he might have commanded the Hand’s obedience, yet he did not. Munkun says that this was because of his respect for the older man, **whilst Mushroom suggests that the two men had become rivals for the affections of the wet nurse Alys Rivers, who had used love potions and philtres to inflame their passions.**

**She was Prince Aemond Targaryen’s lover:**

* Thus did the flower of House Strong, an ancient line of noble warriors boasting descent from the First Men, come to an ignoble end in the ward at Harrenhal. **No trueborn Strong was spared, nor any bastard save … oddly … Alys Rivers. Though the wet nurse was twice his age (thrice, if we put our trust in Mushroom), Prince Aemond had taken her into his bed as a prize of war soon after taking Harrenhal, seemingly preferring her to all the other women of the castle, including many pretty maids of his own years.**
* Prince Aemond refused to consider this “craven course.” As regent for his brother, he might have commanded the Hand’s obedience, yet he did not. Munkun says that this was because of his respect for the older man, **whilst Mushroom suggests that the two men had become rivals for the affections of the wet nurse Alys Rivers, who had used love potions and philtres to inflame their passions. Septon Eustace echoes the dwarf in part, but says it was Aemond alone who had become besotted with the Rivers woman, to such an extent that he could not bear the thought of leaving her.**

**She and Aemond conceived a child:**

* The castle stood empty no more than three days before Lady Sabitha Frey swooped down to seize it. **Inside she found only Alys Rivers, the wet nurse and purported witch who had warmed Prince Aemond’s bed during his days at Harrenhal, and now claimed to be carrying his child. “I have the dragon’s bastard in me,” the woman said, as she stood naked in the godswood with one hand upon her swollen belly. “I can feel his fires licking at my womb.”**
* He had not come alone. **Alys Rivers flew with him, her long hair streaming black behind her, her belly swollen with child.**
* Arriving before the walls of Harrenhal, however, he found the gates closed and hundreds of armed men on the battlements. There were at least six hundred souls within the castle, a third of them men of fighting age. When Ser Regis demanded to speak to their lord, **a woman emerged to treat with him, with a child beside her.** The “witch queen” of Harrenhal proved to be none other than Alys Rivers, the baseborn wet nurse who had been the prisoner and then the paramour of Prince Aemond Targaryen, and now claimed to be his widow. **The boy was Aemond’s, she told the knight. “His bastard?” said Ser Regis. “His trueborn son and heir,” Alys Rivers spat back, “and the rightful king of Westeros.” She commanded the knight to “kneel before your king” and swear him his sword.** Ser Regis laughed at this, saying, “I do not kneel to bastards, much less the baseborn whelp of a kinslayer and a milk cow.”

**She had visions:**

* **“My lady,” Aemond answered. “She saw you in a storm cloud, in a mountain pool at dusk, in the fire we lit to cook our suppers. She sees much and more, my Alys. You were a fool to come alone.”**

**She witnessed the Battle Above the God’s Eye:**

* Prince Daemon took Caraxes up swiftly, lashing him with a steel-tipped whip until they disappeared into a bank of clouds. Vhagar, older and much the larger, was also slower, made ponderous by her very size, and ascended more gradually, in ever widening circles that took her and her rider out over the waters of the Gods Eye. The hour was late, the sun was close to setting, and the lake was calm, its surface glimmering like a sheet of beaten copper. **Up and up she soared, searching for Caraxes as Alys Rivers watched from atop Kingspyre Tower in Harrenhal below.**

**She’s refered to as a ‘witch’ several times:**

* Who was this woman? A serving wench who dabbled in potions and spells, says Munkun. **A woods witch**, claims Septon Eustace. A malign enchantress who bathed in the blood of virgins to preserve her youth, Mushroom would have us believe.
* Was she in truth **a witch who lay with demons**, bringing forth dead children as payment for the knowledge they gave her? Was she a simpleminded slattern, as Eustace believes? A wanton who used her poisons and potions to bind men to her, body and soul?
* The castle stood empty no more than three days before Lady Sabitha Frey swooped down to seize it. Inside she found only Alys Rivers, **the wet nurse and purported witch** who had warmed Prince Aemond’s bed during his days at Harrenhal, and now claimed to be carrying his child.
* She fled back to the Twins soon after … but her prize captive, **the witch woman Alys Rivers**, escaped with Prince Aemond.
* **The “witch queen” of Harrenhal proved to be none other than Alys Rivers**, the baseborn wet nurse who had been the prisoner and then the paramour of Prince Aemond Targaryen, and now claimed to be his widow.
* The **witch queen’s** minions hunted him all through the night before abandoning the chase. Some thirty-two men lived to return to Castle Darry, of the hundred that had set out.

**She’s connected to Harrenhal:**

* **Though her own children had all been stillborn, the milk that flowed so abundantly from the breasts of Alys Rivers had nourished countless babes born of other women at Harrenhal.**
* **Whatever her powers, it would seem Daemon Targaryen was immune to them, for little is heard of this supposed sorceress whilst the prince held Harrenhal.**
* **Thus did the flower of House Strong, an ancient line of noble warriors boasting descent from the First Men, come to an ignoble end in the ward at Harrenhal.** No trueborn Strong was spared, nor any bastard save … oddly … Alys Rivers. Though the wet nurse was twice his age (thrice, if we put our trust in Mushroom), **Prince Aemond had taken her into his bed as a prize of war soon after taking Harrenhal, seemingly preferring her to all the other women of the castle, including many pretty maids of his own years.**
* The loss of King’s Landing and the Iron Throne had enraged him, and **when word of the Fishfeed reached Harrenhal, the Lord Protector had almost strangled the squire who delivered the news. Only the intercession of his bedmate Alys Rivers** had saved the boy’s life.
* The castle stood empty no more than three days before Lady Sabitha Frey swooped down to seize it. **Inside she found only Alys Rivers, the wet nurse and purported witch who had warmed Prince Aemond’s bed during his days at Harrenhal**, and now claimed to be carrying his child.
* **The Kinslayer then returned unexpectedly to Harrenhal**, where he burned every wooden structure in the castle. Six knights and twoscore men-at-arms perished trying to slay his dragon, whilst Lady Sabitha Frey only saved herself from the flames by hiding in a privy. She fled back to the Twins soon after … **but her prize captive, the witch woman Alys Rivers, escaped with Prince Aemond.**
* He had not come alone. **Alys Rivers flew with him**, her long hair streaming black behind her, her belly swollen with child. **Prince Aemond circled twice about the towers of Harrenhal**, then brought Vhagar down in the outer ward, with Caraxes a hundred yards away.
* **The “witch queen” of Harrenhal proved to be none other than Alys Rivers**, the baseborn wet nurse who had been the prisoner and then the paramour of Prince Aemond Targaryen, and now claimed to be his widow. The boy was Aemond’s, she told the knight. “His bastard?” said Ser Regis.

**She seems to be able to cast curses:**

* What happened next remains a matter of some dispute. **Some say that Alys Rivers merely raised a hand, and Ser Regis began to scream and clutch his head, until his skull burst apart, spraying blood and brains.**
* **The name of the messenger is lost to us, along with the name of the man who laughed. But someone did, one of Lord Darry’s men. The messenger looked at him, stricken, then clutched at his throat and began to wheeze. Unable to draw breath, he was dead in moments. Supposedly the imprints of a woman’s fingers could be seen upon his skin, as if she had been in the room, choking him.**

**She may have had a dragon...:**

* **“I’m to tell you what she said,”** he gasped, **“but you can’t laugh. The widow put a curse on me. Any man o’ you laughs, I die.”** When Ser Damon assured him that no one was going to laugh at him, the messenger said, **“Don’t come again unless you mean to bend your knees, she says. Any man who comes near her walls will die. There’s power in them stones, and the widow’s woken it. Seven save us all, she has a dragon. I seen it.”**

**Questions:**

* Who's bastard was she?
* Was she a witch?
* What kind of magic was she using?
* How old was she?
* Is she secretly someone else?
* What happened to her and her child?
* Did she really have a dragon?",1,(Spoilers Extended) Alys Rivers Discussion,11659,42

0,1,0,3,5,"So, in fire and blood, we have the following about First Night rights. A practice of the First Men, intended to make sure that the lord's *powerful blood* is passed on to lesser families. 

&gt;“The Andals never practiced the first night in Andalos,” Grand Maester Benifer said. “When they came to Westeros and swept away the kingdoms of the First Men, they found the tradition in place and chose to let it remain, just as they did the godswoods.”

&gt; “There is more to the first night than lust, Your Grace. The practice is an ancient one, older than the Andals, older than the Faith. It goes back to the Dawn Age, I do not doubt. The First Men were a savage race, and like the wildings beyond the Wall, they followed only strength. Their lords and kings were warriors, mighty men and heroes, and they wanted their sons to be the same. If a warlord chose to bestow his seed upon some maid on her wedding night, it was seen as…a sort of blessing. 

This reminded me of Craster and his procreating with his multiple-daughter wives and passing them on to create White Walkers. His blood seems to be the key, just like in the case of the first night, it was the blood of the powerful lords. Anyone thinks there is something to this?

Edit: Notably, this practice was more common in the North than south of the Neck. And this practice finally got abolished when Alysanne heard of the travails of a girl in Mole's Town due to that parctice. ",1,(Spoilers Extended) First night rights and Craster,1438,50

0,1,0,34,4,"With the recent release of Fire &amp; Blood, I’ve found myself wondering why George wrote this specific book while he’s supposed to be writing TWOW. There must be a reason why he wrote 700 pages on the history of the Targaryens. The upcoming spinoff series having nothing to do with Targaryens apparently so it can’t be that. Maybe it’s simply that he enjoys that aspect of the world he’s built and it’s something he knows well and can write easily. Even if that is the case, I still don’t understand why he’d take time away from writing TWOW so he could write this. It makes me wonder if for some reason he needed to write this, he needed to get the history of the Targaryen dynasty down before he could proceed with the rest of TWOW and ADOS. Maybe there is something involving the coming conflict between Aegon and Daenerys, or Aegon, Daenerys and Jon, that relates to a historical conflict between Targaryens. I haven’t read F&amp;B yet so I don’t know what the comparison would be.

So why doesn't he simply get it over with and conclude the series with TWOW? He's nowhere near completing that either so it should not be too hard to change the ending from a cliffhanger to a definitive finale. Focus on the main stuff:

- Getting Dany to Westeros.
- Getting the White Walkers over the Wall.
- Getting Jon and Dany in bed together.
- Revealing Jon's parentage to Bran.
- Setting up and executing the final battle between Ice (Walkers) and Fire (Dragons).

The relatively minor stuff won't take long to resolve. The Boltons and Sparrows can be taken care of in a couple of chapters, Lady Stoneheart can remain a red herring/minor payoff by killing some Freys and of course, one chapter each for the inevitable Cleganebowl and Stannis the Mannis redemption as a man of the Night's Watch.

With the end so near and so much story to tell, not only will this lead to GRRM getting that motivation that he has lost but will also lead to his best book yet. Best of all, the fans will get closure on the book and TV series around the same time: Spring 2019.

0,1,0,10,10,"I have already posted this in a comment, but thought this tinfoil deserves a post. 

We have Dany's mother being crowned the queen of love and beauty by a knight, Ser Bonifer Hasty, in a doomed affair. 

&gt; ""As a girl, though … she was once smitten with a young knight from the stormlands who wore her favor at a tourney and named her queen of love and beauty. A brief thing.""

We have Dany's lookalike Lynesse being named qolab by another knight, Jorah, in another doomed affair
 
&gt;I crowned Lynesse queen of love and beauty, and that very night went to her father and asked for her hand. 

We have a third knight Selmy wishing that he had crowned another lookalike of Dany, Ashara, in a separate one-sided affair. 

&gt;If I had unhorsed Rhaegar and crowned Ashara queen of love and beauty, might she have looked to me instead of Stark?

And finally to cement the Dany/Ashara/qolab links, we have Princess Daenerys being named qolab. 

&gt;the champion’s laurels went to the gallant and handsome Ser Simon Dondarrion of Blackhaven, who won the love of the commons and queen alike when he crowned Princess Daenerys as his queen of love and beauty.

Worth noting that it was Ashara's sister who was betrothed to the famous Dondarrion of our times, Ser Beric. 

After so many Dany lookalikes, it is quite expected that Dany is being crowned the love and beauty in some tourney by some knight. Looking around for some formidable knight hanging around in our current story..searching...searching. 

Before I search ahead, we have another Dondarrion connect to a knight who crowned someone the qolab. Criston Cole, the son of a steward of the Dondarrions, had crowned Rhaenyra the qolab. 

&gt;Ser Criston Cole. Criston the Kingmaker had set brother against sister and divided the Kingsguard against itself, bringing on the terrible war the singers named the Dance of the Dragons. Some claimed he acted from ambition, for Prince Aegon was more tractable than his willful older sister. Others allowed him nobler motives, and argued that he was defending ancient Andal custom. A few whispered that Ser Criston had been Princess Rhaenyra's lover before he took the white and wanted vengeance on the woman who had spurned him. ""

It is widely expected that there will be a dance between Dany and fAegon. Could there be a new Criston Cole who would crown Dany qolab, who would initially be on her side and then turn into her biggest enemy in a case of love having gone sour, or after realizing that Dany is not easily manipulated. Who would then start supporting a younger more malleable ""Aegon"", just like Ser Cole. Still searching for that dark knight. A knight from our current cast list who is formidable enough to play a big role in our future story. 

All I could come up with was Ser Gerold Dayne. Ser Gerold Dayne of Dorne, Dorne where we get the first quotes about the future dance of dragons in the current series. Also interestingly while we meet Darkstar for the first time in ""the Queenmaker"" chapter, we have the following quote about Criston Cole just a few chapters back.

&gt; ""Who?"" Ser Loras craned his head around to see. ""Ten black pellets on a scarlet field. I do not know those arms."" ""They belonged to Criston Cole, who served the first Viserys and the second Aegon."" Jaime closed the White Book. ""They called him *Kingmaker.*""

Too tinfoily? Let's delve even deeper into the tinfoil waters. This quest started with my hypothesis that every knight of note in GRRM's series has a love story. Jorah has Dany/Lynesse, Jaime has Cersei/Brienne, Selmy has Ashara, Criston had Rhaenyra, Brienne obviously has Jaime, Hound has/had something with Sansa, Lewyn Martell had his *paramour*, Aemon DragonKnight had Naerys, Dunk had several, even Florian had his Jonquil. Only one left Arthur Dayne. 

Either he legitimately broke the trend or he was a part of the trend. And if his story is being hidden, there is perhaps something worth hiding? Anyways I am/was open to any lady love an affair with whom would create further wrinkles in the story. 

Unless it is someone entirely new, the candidates who came to my mind were Ashara or Elia or maybe Lewyn Martell's parmour. Out of these I had dismissed Ashara outright, Arthur couldn't have been fucking his sister. Didn't make much sense, he is no Targ. But then I remembered today, we do have a non-Targaryen fucking his sister, someone who was knighted by Arthur Dayne and someone who desperately wants to be Arthur Dayne. 

&gt;At fifteen, I rode with Ser Arthur Dayne against the Kingswood Brotherhood, and he knighted me on the battlefield....That boy had wanted to be Ser Arthur Dayne, but someplace along the way he had become the Smiling Knight instead...

Someone who was entrusted to protect the Stark girls, just like a certain Arthur Dayne who was at TOJ protecting a Stark girl. Ehh too tinfoily! Then again we do have the Gerold Dayne/Arthur Dayne and the Dany/Ashara links as well. And we posited above that Dany/Dayne may have some sort of one-sided or in some way doomed affair at some point. And we do have Ashara's probable pregnancy being hidden even in a highly loose society like Dorne which accepts bastards more easily than any other culture. And we do have Ashara supposedly jumping off the tower only after she got news of Arthur Dayne's death. And we do have the motif of the girl jumping from the tower after her lover dies. Both in the story of Bael the Bard and in a song heard by Arya. 

&gt; He is a man of the Night's Watch, she thought, as he sang about some stupid lady throwing herself off some stupid tower because her stupid prince was dead. 

What if Ashara's love was not Ned, but ironically Ned had killed Ashara's love? What if the Daynes had honored Ned because this was one of the biggest secrets of the Daynes he had come to know of at TOJ and had protected? What if Jaime ironically has been following Arthur's footsteps since the very beginning? What if we have been unable to find who is Ashara because Ashara is well and truly dead? Just like Arthur and Oswell and Rhaegar and Lyanna? What if? We have had so many Ashara tinfoils over the years, what is one more, eh? :)",1,(Spoilers Extended) Darkstar is the new Criston Cole,6179,52
0,1,0,23,0,"Early on in AGOT there is a scene where a wight tries to attack Jeor Mormont, where he burns his hand very badly

&gt;Jon tried to shout, but his voice was gone. Staggering to his feet, he kicked the arm away and snatched the lamp from the Old Bear's fingers. The flame flickered and almost died. ""Burn!"" the raven cawed. ""Burn, burn, burn!""  
&gt;  
&gt;Spinning, Jon saw the drapes he'd ripped from the window. He flung the lamp into the puddled cloth with both hands. Metal crunched, glass shattered, oil spewed, and the hangings went up in a great whoosh of flame. The heat of it on his face was sweeter than any kiss Jon had ever known. ""Ghost!"" he shouted.  
&gt;  
&gt;The direwolf wrenched free and came to him as the wight struggled to rise, dark snakes spilling from the great wound in its belly. Jon plunged his hand into the flames, grabbed a fistful of the burning drapes, and whipped them at the dead man. Let it burn, he prayed as the cloth smothered the corpse, gods, please, please, let it burn.

We see that this incident's consequences are highlighted throughout the series with Jon flexing his hand every now and then. Also the next thing we see that Jon's hand is still in bandages and it is still paining and it is clear it has been a few days

&gt;The original pommel was a bear's head, silver, yet so worn its features were all but indistinguishable. For you, I thought a white wolf more apt. One of our builders is a fair stonecarver

There are other instances such as one in ADWD where Jon feels the heat of Melisandre when he walked with her

&gt;Jon could feel her heat, even through his wool and boiled leather

Also this in ASOS

&gt;It all seemed to happen in a heartbeat. Afterward Jon could admire the courage of the wildling who reached first for his horn instead of his blade. He got it to his lips, but before he could sound it Stonesnake knocked the horn aside with a swipe of his shortsword. Jon's man leapt to his feet, thrusting at his face with a burning brand. He could feel the heat of the flames as he flinched back. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the sleeper stirring, and knew he must finish his man quick. When the brand swung again, he bulled into it, swinging the bastard sword with both hands.

Basically my point is that Jon is just not at all fire resistant and gets injuries just like normal people

Now some of you might be saying, Targaryens are not Fireproof! It is just from the show! Even GRRM has confirmed it!

But hear me out, GRRM has only confirmed that Dany isnt fireproof but there have been many instances where Dany has shown resistance to heat

Like in her very first chapter:

&gt;They filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with fragrant oils. The girl pulled the rough cotton tunic over Dany’s head and helped her into the tub. The water was scalding hot, but Daenerys did not flinch or cry out. She liked the heat. It made her feel clean. Besides, her brother had often told her that it was never too hot for a Targaryen. ""Ours is the house of the dragon,"" he would say. ""The fire is in our blood.""

or it is known about Drogon when he was very young in ACOK that

&gt;he opened his mouth to scream, steam rising from between his teeth

and yet Dany could resist the heat from half grown Drogon

&gt;Drogon roared. The sound filled the pit. A furnace wind engulfed her (ADWD Pit scene)

and this:

&gt;Dany hit him. “No,” she screamed, swinging the lash with all the strength that she had in her. The dragon jerked his head back. “No,” she screamed again. “NO!” The barbs raked along his snout. Drogon rose, his wings covering her in shadow. Dany swung the lash at his scaled belly, back and forth until her arm began to ache. His long serpentine neck bent like an archer’s bow. With a hisssssss, he spat black fire down at her. Dany darted underneath the flames, swinging the whip and shouting, “No, no, no. Get DOWN!” His answering roar was full of fear and fury, full of pain. His wings beat once, twice …

Even if this shows that Dany escaped the flames in her last chapter it is clear that she was burned after all but those were minor injuries.

Also we know that Dragon flame is even more hotter than wildfire but in spite of that she just get minor injuries

And it isnt just Dany, other Targaryens are known to show resistance to heat as well

In Dunk and Egg

&gt;\[Aegon\] liked the heat. In Dorne he went about bare-chested, and turned brown as a Dornishman. It is his dragon blood, Dunk told himself. Whoever heard of a sweaty dragon?

Also Jon repeatedly gets sweaty even being at the Wall whereas Dany is often described to see only some sweat drops that too when she is in the sun

Edit: Some of you have been saying Viserys still died by the gold, but gold melts at 1000 degrees which is definitely going to be more than any resistance Targaryens have got

So based on all the quotes it seems clear that Targaryens are resistant to fire whereas Jon shows no such important trait...

0,1,0,11,26,"Here’s a passage from when Arya first enters the House of Black and White.

&gt;The septs of Westeros were seven-sided, with seven altars for the seven gods, but here there were more gods than seven. Statues of them stood along the walls, massive and threatening. Around their feet red candles flickered, as dim as distant stars. The nearest was a marble woman twelve feet tall. Real tears were trickling from her eyes, to fill the bowl she cradled in her arms. Beyond her was a man with a lion’s head seated on a throne, carved of ebony. On the other side of the doors, a huge horse of bronze and iron reared up on two great legs. Farther on she could make out a great stone face, a pale infant with a sword, a shaggy black goat the size of an aurochs, a hooded man leaning on a staff. The rest were only looming shapes to her, half-seen through the gloom.

George used this as an opportunity to reference the Thousand Worlds, and there are gods we’re already familiar with, like the Black Goat and the Great Stallion.

But what if this isn’t simply a collection of random gods, what if they were put there on purpose? I think the gods of the House of Black and White each represent a person searching for Arya. But do they represent those who have searched in past books, or do they foreshadow events to come in The Winds of Winter?

**The Weeping Woman**

&gt;The nearest was a marble woman twelve feet tall. Real tears were trickling from her eyes, to fill the bowl she cradled in her arms.

The first statue Arya sees is the Weeping Woman of Lys. This goddess reminds me of Catelyn Stark.

Catelyn Stark has been likened to Alyssa Arryn, a lady who lost her family in war.

&gt;Sometimes she felt as though her heart had turned to stone; six brave men had died to bring her this far and she could not even find it in her to weep for them.
_________________________________________________________________________
&gt;Alyssa Arryn had seen her husband, her brothers, and all her children slain, and yet in life she had never shed a tear. So in death, the gods had decreed that she would know no rest until her weeping watered the black earth of the Vale, where the men she had loved were buried. Alyssa had been dead six thousand years now, and still no drop of the torrent had ever reached the valley floor far below. Catelyn wondered how large a waterfall her own tears would make when she died.

And the description of Alyssa’s statue reminds reminds me of the Weeping Woman of Lys. 

&gt;Below, two guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks led forth Tyrion Lannister. The Eyrie’s plump septon escorted him to the statue in the center of the garden, a **weeping woman carved in veined white marble**, no doubt meant to be Alyssa.

We already know that Lady Stoneheart is searching for Arya. 

&gt;""He answers to the name of Sandor Clegane. Thoros says he was making for the Twins…
_________________________________________________________________________
&gt;“He would have had a child with him,” said the singer. “A skinny girl, about ten. Or perhaps a boy the same age.”

And this search continues into A Feast for Crows, with the Brotherhood collecting orphans at the Crossroads Inn.

**The Lion Of Night**

&gt;Beyond her was a man with a lion’s head seated on a throne, carved of ebony.

Next Arya sees a statue of the Lion of Night, a god from Yi Ti. He reminds me of Cersei Lannister.

Cersei’s sigil is a lion, rich men pray to the Lion of the Night and the Lannisters are rich, and the ebony throne matches the dark steel of the Iron Throne. 

Cersei has searched for Arya in the past, placing guardsmen in Stark cloaks at the Wind Witch to capture her.

Or maybe the statue points to the future, and not to Cersei, but Jaime. Maybe Jaime will lead the Brotherhood from a weirwood throne instead of an ebony one and continue the search for Arya.

**The Great Stallion**

&gt;On the other side of the doors, a huge horse of bronze and iron reared up on two great legs.

Next Arya sees the horse god of the Dothraki, which the show calls the Great Stallion. This statue doesn’t remind me of the Dothraki, but of Jon Snow.

Bronze and iron paired are the metals of winter.

&gt;…Robb’s crown looked much as the other was said to have looked in the tales told of the Stark kings of old; an open circlet of hammered bronze incised with the runes of the First Men, surmounted by nine black iron spikes wrought in the shape of longsword. Of gold and silver and gemstones it had none; bronze and iron were the metals of winter, dark and strong to fight against the cold.
_________________________________________________________________________
&gt;To Winterfell we pledge the faith of Greywater,” they said together. Hearth and heart and harvest we yield up to you, my lord. Our swords and spears and arrows are yours to command. Grant mercy to our weak, help to our helpless, and justice to all, and we shall never fail you.” “I swear it by earth and water,” said the boy in green. “I swear it by bronze and iron,” his sister said.” “We swear it by ice and fire,” they finished together.

Whether he takes up the role or not, Jon was named heir in Robb’s will, and even while in the Night’s Watch he has fought against the cold.

Jon is also connected to horses through his mother, who’s noted as a great rider and called a centaur.

Jon’s search for Arya has already begun, with him sending Mance and his spearwives to Winterfell, rescuing Alys Karstark, and planning to march south with an army of wildlings.

**The Merling King**

&gt;Farther on she could make out a great stone face…

Next Arya sees the Merling King. It’s not certain that it is this god, but it’s the only god mentioned later that matches this description.

The *Merling King* is also a ship. For this reason the statue reminds me of Littlefinger.

The *Merling King* carries Littlefinger and Sansa to Sheepshit.

&gt;Lord Tywin turned back to Littlefinger. “If Lysa Arryn will take you for a husband and return to the king’s peace, we shall restore the Lord Robert to the honor of Warden of the East. How soon might you leave?” “On the morrow, if the winds permit. There’s a Braavosi galley standing out past the chain, taking on cargo by boat. The Merling King. I’ll see her captain about a berth.”

Littlefinger hasn’t expressed much interest in Arya. But he has schemed to collect noble hostages in the past. [Could he be searching for Arya](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/101178-arya-is-busted/)? 

Will Littlefinger continue this search in the future? Why? Or could the Merling King point to someone else?

**Bakkalon**

&gt;…a pale infant with a sword,

Next Arya sees Bakkalon. We don’t know much about this god, just that soldiers pay to it and it’s associated with death. Bakkalon is a god from the Thousand Worlds universe, and likely just an easter egg. However, it also reminds me of Beric Dondarrion.

Beric’s rebirths and lack of memories as he fights his war reminds me of the infant with a sword. Beric points that out himself, and asks if Thoros is his mother.

&gt;""Can I dwell on what I scarce remember? I held a castle on the Marches once, and there was a woman I was pledged to marry, but I could not find that castle today, nor tell you the color of that woman’s hair. Who knighted me, old friend? What were my favorite foods? It all fades. Sometimes I think I was born on the bloody grass in that grove of ash, with the taste of fire in my mouth and a hole in my chest. Are you my mother, Thoros?""

If the statues do reference future events, I’m at a loss since Beric is now dead for good. Maybe Sansa, after hearing of Arya’s wedding to Ramsay, will convince Sweetrobin to send men north to search for her, and the statue alludes to that? I doubt it.

**The Black Goat**

&gt;…a shaggy black goat the size of an aurochs…

Next Arya sees the Black Goat, the god of Qohor.

To me, this matches the Brave Companions. The Brave Companions are led by Vargo Hoat, a Qohorik, who wears a goat helm and flies a black goat as his banner.

When Arya escaped Harrenhal with Gendry and Hot Pie, she feared the Brave Companions would be sent after them.

&gt;The Lord of the Dreadfort would not come after them himself. Roose Bolton would stay abed, his pasty flesh dotted with leeches, giving commands in his whispery soft voice. His man Walton might lead the hunt, the once they called Steelshanks for the greaves he always wore on his long legs. Or perhaps it would be slobbery Vargo Hoat and his sellswords, who named themselves the Brave Companions.

In a dream, Arya wargs Nymeria and dispatches the pursuing sellswords.

If the statue refers to the future, who could the Black Goat be? By now most of the Brave Companions are dead, the rest scattered. It could point to Rorge and Biter, who later would sack Saltpans, possibly while searching for Arya. Or the “shaggy black goat the size of an aurochs” could point to Shaggydog, and suggest that Rickon will command a search for Arya after fArya’s identity is revealed.

**The Hooded Wayfarer**

&gt;a hooded man leaning on a staff…

Lastly, Arya sees the Hooded Wayfarer, a god that we know nothing about. This statue reminds me of Sandor Clegane.

The Hooded Wayfarer is prayed to by the poor, and the theft of Sandor’s gold by the Brotherhood sets off his search for Arya in order to ransom her. The god is hooded, and as a gravedigger Sandor wears a cowl to cover his face. The statue leans on a staff, and the gravedigger is lame. Could Sandor search for Arya again in the future?

**Too Long, Didn’t Read**

The statues in the House of Black and White could point to people that have, or will, search for Arya.

This is a bit of a rough list of some interesting things I noticed on my first read of Fire and Blood Vol. 1:

* Oldtown has a bank, the first Westerosi we’ve heard of so far, I believe.
* House Bolton didn’t have a presence, I could find only one mention of them, House Manderly were more focused on them than House Bolton.
* There was an Alayne Royce, seems like a little reference to Sansa and her connection to the Royces.
* A Blackwood-Targaryen marriage had been considered before Aegon and Betha with Daella Targaryen and Royce Blackwood.
* House Farman’s words are “The Wind Our Steed”.

* Princess Daenerys and Queen Alysanne were both crowned as queens of love and beauty.
* Gael the Winter Child’s story follows the same Bael the Bards beats as seen throughout the series.
* There was a good bit of racism expressed by some of the characters, Princess Daella thought a prince from the Summer Isles was a “demon” because of his dark skin, there’s a lot of emphasis on Nettles being “brown”, there were a lot of rumors about the Rogares due to them being Lyseni, etc.

0,1,0,17,1,"All I understood was that Corlys had already succeeded in making peace, just the confirmation of the acceptance by the various lords was awaited. But Cregan took advantage of this interim period to hold sway over KL, just itching for war. In a short term, the peace terms sent by Corlys were accepted by the various lords and the realm was gathering against Cregan, since he had imprisoned Corlys. Still Cregan with his 20,000 men kept spoiling for war and since nobody wanted another battle, they agreed to his terms. Given he himself supported the blacks and was spoiling for war in favour of the blacks, the only reason I can think of for his wanting to execute Corlys and the rest was because he was denied war. The next thing we know Cregan gets swayed by a Blackwood girl and moves North. 

I didn't really understand what was the point of introducing this whole episode in the Dance, it neither resolved any big plots (it was Corlys' terms and the realm's exhaustion with war which had already done that), nor did it add to future plots. So what is its significance? Also does anyone think we see it repeated it in some form? I would say Cregan is Jon, except he seems the exact opposite of *conciliator*.

0,1,0,6,12,"I always thought it was sort of weird that language in Westeros is so standardized, despite it supposedly being the size of South America. Yes, there is a caste of nerds who presumably have the job of making dictionaries and keeping everyone's grammar precisely in line, but still, Westeros is so huge, even with the Maesters working round the clock to correct everyone's grammar, it would be impossible to retain one cohesive language. So in my headcanon, the Common Tongue is divided into seven extra languages.

The biggest one is just called ""Southron,"" and it is spoken in the Westerlands, the Reach, the Riverlands, the Crownlands, and the Stormlands. It's basically the Andal language, although quite heavily influenced by the language of the First Men, such that it's very different from the language the Andals would have spoken in Andalos. There are also very large divides between dialects, especially among the smallfolk. The areas close to Kings Landing speak very differently from the Riverlands, and so on.

The next language is that of the Vale. While the Vale is generally considered a southron Kingdom, the mountains make communication and transportation between it and the rest of Westeros hard, so in my headcanon, their language is basically Old Andal, with very few changes, as according to the lore, the Vale was wholly conquered by the Andals and the First Men have very little remaining cultural influence. Since they are isolated behind their mountain, it would make sense for them to speak in a way closer to old Andal. The tongue of the Vale is generally considered to be archaic and stuffy by the people of the other southron kingdoms due to its usage of outdated linguistic forms found only in the remaining Andals in Essos.

Dorne also has a strange language, with probably the most diverse set of influences of any of the other languages of Westeros. Like Southron, it is based upon Andal, with quite a bit of influence from the First Men, but it also has a ton of influence from the Rhoynar, which also makes it very hard to learn for other Westerosis. This, and its varied bases, lead to Dornish having a reputation for being complicated with contradictory grammar rules, much like real life English.

The North speaks a language that is mostly based on First Men. While there has been some Andal influence in the language, the fact that the North mostly runs its own affairs has lead to the language of the North remaining firmly in the First Man-descended language group. However, the concessions it has made to the Andal language are largely in the areas of grammar, and not vocabulary, so as to make it more easily learnt by southron lords. The Crannogmen also have their own, fully separate language (not just a dialect of Northman) developed due to how the Neck is somehow even more isolated than the North.

The Ironmen have their own language, which is basically the language the Ironmen have spoken for centuries. Their autonomy has - much like in the North - allowed them to retain many of their language's distinctive features. The language family the Iron Tongue is a part of is hard to discern, but most theories say that it is descended from either the tongue of the First Men, or is a wholly separate language group unto itself.

The Wildlings speak the language closest to the Old Tongue of the First Men in Westeros, other than the Thenn. Separated from the rest of the continent by the Wall, their language has had very little study dedicated to it, for the obvious reason that few Maesters dare travel amongst the Wildlings. Many Maesters excitedly talk about using the language of the Wildlings to gain a greater understanding of the Old Tongue, but still, little study has been done. A variant of this language is also spoken in Skagos.

Most lords in Westeros (at least in my headcanon) speak a Westerosi form of High Valyrian, in which Valyrian vocabulary is fit into Andal grammar to make it easier to learn. This language is the *lingua franca* of the lords and merchants of Westeros, and is how they can speak to each other. The Targaryens are usually the only house which teaches its members true High Valyrian. Lords of course learn the language spoken in their lands, and usually some other languages, depending on their location. Few learn the tongue of the Crannogmen, even in the North, which feeds into their isolation, as usually only the Starks deign to educate their children in the language of the frogmen.

0,1,0,6,13,"I have a few questions about the small council meeting in Tyrion III, A Storm of Swords.

First there’s Littlefinger.

&gt;”I ought to write Robb Stark a stern letter,” Littlefinger was saying. “I understand his man Bolton is stabling goats in *my* high hall, it’s really quite unconscionable.”

Why does Littlefinger say this? Is he trying to get a rise out of Tywin? Is he trying to see how Varys reacts to the mention of the Brave Companions? Is he trying to play up caring about Harrenhal even though he doesn’t? Or is he trying to play up not caring about Harrenhal even though he does by sounding like he's joking about writing a letter? Is he hinting to Varys that he might write a letter to the Starks about something else?

Then there’s Redwyne and Tyrell:

&gt;Lord Redwyne laughed. “What is there north of the Neck that any sane man would want? If Greyjoy will trade swords and sails for stone and snow, I say do it, and count ourselves lucky.” “Truly,” agreed Mace Tyrell. “That’s what I would do. Let King Balon finish the northmen whilst we finish Stannis.”

Are they trying to cover up their interest in the North, since they are plotting to marry Sansa to Willas Tyrell? 

Or was Redwyne not informed of this plot, and simply wants to avoid war with the ironmen since he knows his ships will do the bulk of the fighting?

&gt;”May we return to the matter of the Greyjoy alliance? In my view, there is much to be said for it. Greyjoy’s longships will augment my own fleet and give us sufficient strength at sea to assault Dragonstone and end Stannis Baratheon’s pretensions.”

Did Redwyne and Tyrell have plans for the Vale? 

&gt;Lord Tywin’s face gave no hint as to his feelings. “There is Lysa Arryn to deal with as well. Jon Arryn’s widow, Hoster Tully’s daughter, Catelyn Stark’s sister…whose husband was conspiring with Stannis Baratheon at the time of his death.” “Oh,” said Mace Tyrell cheerfully., “women have no stomach for war. Let her be, I say, she’s not like to trouble us.” “I agree,” said Redwyne. “The Lady Lysa took no part in the fighting, nor has she committed any over acts of treason.”

They do dismiss the idea of sending Tyrion to the Vale with a Lannister army.

&gt;Mace Tyrell’s smile was jovial, but behind it Tyrion sensed contempt. “Perhaps you’d best leave the fighting to fighters,” said the Lord of Highgarden. “Better men than you have shattered lost great armies in the Mountains of the Moon, or shattered them against the Bloody Gate. We know your worth, my lord, no need to tempt fate.”

An alliance with the ironborn would have allowed a naval invasion of the Vale with the Redwyne fleet.

They also exchange a look when Littlefinger mentions using his elevated status as Lord of Harrenhal to marry Lysa.

&gt;”Now though…a match between the Lady of the Eyrie and the Lord of Harrenhal is not so unthinkable, is it?” Tyrion noted the look that passed between Paxter Redwyne and Mace Tyrell. 

Are they upset that Littlefinger neutralizing the Vale will prevent war, which would have given the Reach lords a chance to seize more castles from their defeated foes?

Then there’s the exchange between Mace Tyrell and Littlefinger:

&gt;”You will miss the king’s wedding,” said Mace Tyrell. Petyr Baelish gave a shrug. “Tides and brides wait on no man, my lord. Once the autumn storms begin the voyage will be much more hazardous. Drowning would definitely diminish my charms as a bridegroom.” Lord Tyrell chuckled. “**True. Best you do not linger**.”

Does Mace know about Littlefinger’s role in poisoning Joffrey? Does he know about the upcoming assassination at all? Or does he not like Littlefinger, seeing him as an upjumped Lannister lackey who’s stolen the seats they could have won through an eventual war with the Vale?",1,(Spoilers Published) Small Council Meeting,3776,42

However one thing that bothers me is how annoyingly powerful GRRM made dragons. Talk about an absolute unit. One page I’ll be reading about an interesting new rebel or invader, and their detailed strategies of war. Then it all gets wrapped up in a sentence that usually is something to the effect of  “king ___ mounted his dragon and burned them all”, and that’s it. An entire war ended in a few sentences by these super weapons. It makes me wonder why anyone even bothers trying to fight the Targs. So many times there could be interesting battles and shifts in history if it wasn’t for these damn dragons. Also, the speed in which wars are concluded is too fast and clean. They’ll just say everyone was killed “to a man”, which is really improbable. There has never been a war were every single person on one side was killed (as far as I know). Irl wars have enormous impacts on the area for years to come, but not in asoiaf. After they unrealistically kill all the invaders, it’s like nothing ever happened.

(I will talk about spoilers from the book in this post, so if you don't want some specific historical anecdote spoiled, turn back now)

F&amp;B is not a novel. It is not a narrative following one set of characters; it is not a tight third-person POV. If you go into looking to compare it to novels and other, similar works of fiction, you will be disappointed and bored. 

Instead, F&amp;B is a pop history book. Like [The Conquest of the Incas](https://www.amazon.com/Conquest-Incas-John-Hemming/dp/0156028263), [1491](https://www.amazon.com/1491-Revelations-Americas-Before-Columbus/dp/1400032059) (and [1493](https://www.amazon.com/1493-Uncovering-World-Columbus-Created-ebook/dp/B004G606EY)), or China Mieville's [October](https://www.amazon.com/October-Russian-Revolution-China-Mi%C3%A9ville/dp/1784782777). Except it's a pop history book about fake, made-up history. It's a weird undertaking on its face. To make this book work, you need to have enough people who care about the fake history you're writing, and you have to be able to make that fake history compelling enough to be better than your notes. 

On both counts, the book succeeds. Obviously the audience is there. Look at us. But more than that, GRRM has successfully turned notes into a pop-fantasy-history book that rivals real pop-history books. There's the historiographic drama as we get conflicting accounts from different sources and authors, of course. That's a big part of the draw, I think, and something GRRM does well. We knew that already from *The Princess &amp; The Queen*. But there's another strength demonstrated here: implication.

The fun of reading a pop-history book is having the author present details in such a way to suggest - but not explicitly lay out - a narrative. Presenting key quotes from historical figures, coupled with precise details about social and cultural context, can paint a really powerful picture of the scenes in question. Coming back to China Mieville for a second, this is something done exceptionally well in *October.* Mieville knows just where to put each detail to create a narrative from the chaos of history - without reducing any of the real, human dramas to 2-dimensional soap opera. (In case you can't tell, I highly recommend *October.*)

GRRM, of course, has the opposite problem a historian has: he's making it all up. He isn't turning chaos into structure - he's creating the illusion of chaos behind structure. That is, in order for F&amp;B to work, he has to make it feel as rich and broad as our own history, while still winnowing the details down to a workable narrative. 

And in that? GRRM succeeds! 

There's certainly parts of this book that could be better. Maegor's reign in particular is one long litany of endlessly gruesome crimes that don't feel particularly unique from one another. But there are moments of genuine drama and tension. One that stood out was the pardoning of Joffrey Doggett, the Red Dog of the hills. Throughout the Faith Militant conflicts, the Red Dog is built up as a major threat to lasting peace in Westeros, a rebel figure who seems unkillable. Yet when he stands before the newly-crowned Jaehaerys to face his fate, Jaehaerys forgives the Red Dog and names him to his Kingsguard. It doesn't read like a novel, this scene: it reads like a pop-history book. 

I know this will come off fannish. And F&amp;B isn't for everyone! If you find it boring, that's fine! I'm not trying to tell you that you are wrong or dumb. But in thinking about this project, it's important to look at what GRRM's goals were. Obviously it isn't *The Winds of Winter.* And obviously it's not a conventional novel. His goal was to write a compelling book of pop-history about his fantasy world. He succeeded. ",1,(Spoilers Extended) Fire &amp; Blood Volume 1 is good,3790,53

0,1,0,43,0,"Everything in Sansa’s story arc has to come full circle and she needs to show character development. She started out as a little girl who believes in songs of love, but after everything she has gone through, that girl is no more. And at this point, Sansa’s ultimate goal is to go back to Winterfell.

Let’s look at the people who have been major influences in her life since Ned died:

* \- Margaery and Olenna Tyrell
* \- Cersei
* \- Littlefinger

From Margaery and Olenna, she learns how to use marriage to further her goals.

From Cersei, she learns how to use sexuality as a weapon.

From Littlefinger, she learns how to scheme and plot.

Given the above, this is how I believe Sansa’s story will play out:

She will not marry Harry the Heir. Sansa has already been used as a tool for multiple marriage arrangements (e.g. Joffrey, Loras, Tyrion). I highly doubt she will allow to be used as a tool for others anymore.

Instead, she will use her influence over Sweetrobin to convince him to marry her. After all, he is still Lord Paramount of the Vale, regardless of Littlefinger’s role as regent. If Sweetrobin wants to marry Sansa, he will make it happen. This is how Olenna and Margaery’s influence some into play. Margaery charmed Joffrey to choose her over Sansa, and Olenna chose her husband and prevented an unwanted marriage to a Targaryan.

&lt;Not Going to Happen&gt;Once Sansa marries him, she will need to secure an heir in order to further strengthen her place in the Vale. But she knows Sweetrobin is going to die soon due to the poison that Littlefinger is dosing him with, and he is probably not physically capable of providing an heir, so she is going to find one elsewhere that will be convincing enough that it can be passed off as his. She already suspects Littlefinger is Sweetrobin’s father, they are spitting images of each other, and the seed is strong, so she will seduce Littlefinger to obtain her heir. I highly doubt Littlefinger will object to her seduction since we know she is one of his weaknesses. Once Sansa is with child, she will poison Littlefinger as he has served his purpose. This is Cersei’s influence over her- using sex as a weapon and procuring “heirs” to secure her position.&lt;/Not Going to Happen&gt;

Her final endgame is to head to Winterfell with the Knights of the Vale to take it from the Boltons, or whomever is holding Winterfell. By this time, she will have Harry the Heir in her back pocket because he too will become smitten with her, and in her eyes, would be the perfect person to lead the Knights of the Vale to victory. The long term scheming to achieve her final goal is what she learned from Littlefinger.

Sansa’s going to end up at Winterfell one way or another, and not through Littlefinger’s scheming, but her own.

&gt; [Spoilers F&amp;B Vol 1]  &gt;!“Why be a lord when you can be a king?” he told the men who began to gather round him. And talk was heard in camp of a prophecy of ancient days that said, **“When the hammer shall fall upon the dragon, a new king shall arise, and none shall stand before him.”** Whence came these words remains a mystery (not from Hammer himself, who could neither read nor write), but within a few days every man at Tumbleton had heard them.!&lt;

So this very well could just be a lie to drum up support or to ingratiate themselves to Hugh *but* what if this were really a prophecy from ancient days? As it clearly is meant to make the reader think of Robert besting Rhaegar with his hammer at the Trident. 

&amp;nbsp;

0,1,0,13,14,"The final paragraph of chapter 3: 'Three Heads Had The Dragon' of Fire and Blood says that sixteen Targaryen Kings followed Aegon before Robert's rebellion. HOW ??? So gyldayn knows not just the number of Kings that would come after his death, but also the name of the guy who would overthrow the last of those Kings, a guy who's probably not even born yet.

Let's keep in mind that during an interview for twoiaf, Grrm said that he briefly entertained the idea of ending Gyldayn's history series with a giant ink stain on the page because that is how how he dies in Summerhall, trying to write down what happened there, but ink falls all over it, that is how accurate he wanted to be, so there's no chance that this is author error.

Could it mean that the text we are shown is manipulated by someone who edited it after Robert became king, in order to change the history some more because now we have a different monarch and a different dynasty ?

I personally believe that the maester meddling in the affairs of the seven kingdoms is a fact, not just a theory, what's left up to speculation is only how deep the conspiracy goes.

Also, I may be misremembering, but didn't sons of the dragon end with gyldayn saying that the history of jaehaerys's reign would be written by some other maester, not him ? Maybe he changed his mind, but still, where is that line ? Someone has definitely edited it. 

There seem to be other changes as well, like when the high septon, a Hightower, offered Aegon the hand of his neice for maegor, who became maegor's first wife; if i remember correctly, gyldayn mentioned in sons of dragon of Hightower's ambition when he made that proposal, but that line is missing from fire and blood.

Maybe someone is trying to twist historical events, could Yandel be involved ? Would all of this be part of Sam's story in twow ?

0,1,0,41,52,"In season 7 of *Game of Thrones*, Petyr Baelish was executed for his crimes. And while the whole Winterfell storyline was quite nonsensical, i think most of us would agree, that the core ideas - Sansa being his downfall, his past crimes catching up to him, a trial and his death - will most likely be present in the books. These are good ideas, fitting for his character, even with flawed execution.

And among the many flaws, there is one that doesn't get enough attention. Why didn't Baelish ask for a trial by combat? That should've been his last resort. Instead of asking Royce to take him away, he should've asked someone to fight for him!

And i think we'll see such thing in the books. Backed into a corner, Littlefinger will try to save his life by playing ""trial by combat"" card. He'll be expecting to have one of his men to step in and save his life. It won't happen. In fact, i think there is a character that is set up scecifically so that he could turn on him - Lothor Brune. He is Littlefinger's sworn knight, he's the one who does his dirty work (like killing Dontos), he is the closest thing Baelish has to a person he can trust. 

&gt;With his squashed nose, square jaw, and nap of woolly grey hair, Brune could not be called comely, but he was not ugly either. It is a common face but an honest one. Though he had risen to knighthood, Ser Lothor’s birth had been very low. One night he had told her that he was kin to the Brunes of Brownhollow, an old knightly family from Crackclaw Point. “I went to them when my father died,” he confessed, “but they shat on me, and said I was no blood of theirs.” He would not speak of what happened after that, except to  say that he had learned all he knew of arms the hard way. Sober, he was a quiet man, but a strong one. **And Petyr says he’s loyal. He trusts him as much as he trusts anyone.**

And in AFFC, GRRM starts to develop him as a character. We learn his backstory, we see, that he is a decent man. We learn about his love for Mya Stone. And he starts to develop a bit of a bond with Sansa.

&gt;Near the keep, she ran headlong into Ser Lothor Brune and almost knocked him off his feet. ""Harry the Heir? Harry the Arse, I say. He's just some upjumped squire.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Alayne was so grateful that she hugged him.**

I think this dynamic will continue in the next chapters. Lothor may very well be the pay off to ""true knights"" theme in Sansa's story. Life is not a song, knights are no heroes, but unlike Littlefinger, Sansa won't become a bitter cynic after her romanic worlview is challenged, but instead will try to turn the world into a place she thought it was. And she will turn Lothor into a true knight. 

So given Lothor's honest nature, his bond with Sansa and his affection for Mya, i can totally see him refusing to fight for Baelish after hearing the case against him. He caused the deaths of both of the girls fathers after all.

&gt;“Tell me, Alayne - which is more dangerous, the dagger brandished by an enemy, or the hidden one pressed to your back by someone you never even see?”

Given these words and Littlefinger's backstabbing nature in general, it would be so perfect for his own sword to turn on him. Also,  I think it will be a great parallel to Petyr's betrayal of Ned. Sansa will pull a Littlefinger on Littlefield by turning his ally against him in a time when he needs him most. 

So no one will want to fight for Littlefinger. No Bronn or Oberyn for him. Which means he'll have to defend his life himself. Which would be amazing. Because of this:

&gt;They met in the lower bailey of Riverrun. When Brandon saw that Petyr wore only helm and breastplate and mail, he took off most of his armor. Petyr had begged her for a favor he might wear, but she had turned him away. Her lord father promised her to Brandon Stark, and so it was to him that she gave her token, a pale blue handscarf she had embroidered with the leaping trout of Riverrun. As she pressed it into his hand, she pleaded with him. ""He is only a foolish boy, but I have loved him like a brother. It would grieve me to see him die."" And her betrothed looked at her with the cool grey eyes of a Stark and promised to spare the boy who loved her.  
&gt;  
&gt;That fight was over almost as soon as it began. Brandon was a man grown, and he drove Littlefinger all the way across the bailey and down the water stair, raining steel on him with every step, until the boy was staggering and bleeding from a dozen wounds. ""Yield!"" he called, more than once, but Petyr would only shake his head and fight on, grimly. When the river was lapping at their ankles, Brandon finally ended it, with a brutal backhand cut that bit through Petyr's rings and leather into the soft flesh below the ribs, so deep that Catelyn was certain that the wound was mortal. He looked at her as he fell and murmured ""Cat"" as the bright blood came flowing out between his mailed fingers. She thought she had forgotten that.

I think that at he end, it will come back to this. Littlefinger never got over this trauma. 17 years later, he is still trying to get Catelyn back. So it only makes sense for it to end like this.  Stripped of his gold, his lies and his plans, he'll end up right where he started.

And in this context his opponent - a stand in for Brandon - has to be Harold Harding. A stong and handome, heir to the ancient powerful house, a groom to his beloved lady.

And in this fight, we'll see who Petyr actually is. Is he still capable to be brave in the face of death? Or previous experience coupled with decades of lies and intrigues killed this part of him, and he'll be begging and running away? I supect the latter, but no matter how he performs, he will loose this battle. But this time,  lady Stark won't ask her betrothed to spare him. And this is how it's going to end for him:

And in no way am I saying that the anger is unjustified. I'm just stating here why I don't care when the next book comes out.

Thanks to GRRM I attended Hogwarts, traveled Middle Earth, met The Big Brother, flew with dragons and so many more. I'm actually going to install a new bookshelf this weekend because I'm out of space.

In all honesty, ASOIAF is no longer my favorite series (blasphemy, I know. It is a close second if it makes it better). I'm forever thankful to GRRM in making me believe that reading is so much damn fun.

**Edit**: this really blew up. I’m so happy to hear that so many of us share the love of reading and I absolutely loved hearing the different ways we owe GRRM for so many different things.

This is probably bullshit, so I'm not going to write out a lengthy post.

George has been asked about this, and there probably isn’t much to it, but I’m bored.

&gt;“Is there any particular reason why the Dornish arms tend to be so…macabre?”
&gt;“A violent history. Particularly the mountain houses, who lived by raiding across the border into the marches, feuded with each other endlessly, and were the first to face any invaders.”

Even so, House Blackmont makes me think of human sacrifice. Their sigil is a vulture carrying an infant, which reminds me of blood magic and the sacrifice of bastards and undesirables in other areas of the Seven Kingdoms. 

Benedict Blackmont, the last king, is said to have worshipped a dark god and have the power to transform himself into a giant vulture. Now that may just be legend. Robb was said to have giants and wargs in his army in the Westerlands, when really events were just misinterpreted by scared soldiers. Still, those rumors hinted at the truth. Could Benedict have simply been a skinchanger? 

And what dark god did he worship? Could the “god” have just been the remnant of some ancient race living in the nearby mountains? Is this supported by the name of the castle, Blackmont? Is the mountain black, or those who resides there? Could the black mountain have obsidian or oily black stone in it?",1,(Spoilers Published) House Blackmont,1541,36

0,1,0,1,7,"I think White Harbor will be destroyed.

I don’t want to write out a lengthy post because this is all speculation based on Davos’ visit to the Merman’s Court in A Dance with Dragons.

When Davos visits the Merman’s Court, he says,

&gt;“He came to save the realm, my lord,” Davos insisted. “To defend your lands against the ironborn and the wildlings.” Next to the high seat, Ser Marlon Manderly gave a snort of disdain. “It has been centuries since White Harbor has seen any wildlings, and the ironmen have never troubled this coast. Does Lord Stannis propose to defend us from snarks and dragons too?”

I think that because of how quickly these enemies are dismissed, when we readers know how serious some of them are, means all of them will threaten the city at some point.

**Ironmen**

The ironmen are on the far side of Westeros, but some stragglers from the Iron Fleet have already moved into the Stepstones and the Stormlands. Also, if Euron disperses his forces like [arms of the kraken](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6a0cnm/spoilers_extended_the_arms_of_the_kraken_part_2/) to attack all over the coasts, and with Manderly forces occupied in defeating the Boltons and helping Stannis reenforce the Wall, White Harbor could be vulnerable to raids. Of course, with the city’s defenses strengthened I doubt they would be a major threat.

&gt;White Harbor's walls of whitewashed stone rose before them, on the eastern shore where the White Knife plunged into the firth. Some of the city's defenses had been strengthened since the last time Davos had been here, half a dozen years before. The jetty that divided the inner and outer harbors had been fortified with a long stone wall, thirty feet tall and almost a mile long, with towers every hundred yards. There was smoke rising from Seal Rock as well, where once there had been only ruins. That could be good or bad, depending on what side Lord Wyman chooses.

**Wildlings**

Wildlings have been allowed through the Wall, but I think the greater threat to the North is not Mance or Tormund, but the Weeper.

If the Asha fragment can be believed, Crowfood Umber was killed by the Freys as they marched on the crofter’s village. 

&gt;“Before him rode three banner bearers. One bore the stag and lion standard of King Tommen, another the Twin Towers of House Frey. The third brandished a bloody head impaled upon the point of a tall spear. An old man’s head it was, white-bearded and one eyes. The spear was…with a pale wood, almost white. … its upper shaft had … dark and red. Crowfood Umber, Asha knew. The old northman had fought to his death, it seemed.”

This was foreshadowed by Ser Godry Farring in Stannis’ war council at Castle Black.

&gt;“You would make His Grace look weak. I say, show our strength. Burn Last Hearth to the ground and ride to war with Crowfood’s head mounted on a spear, as a lesson to the next lord who presumes to offer half his homage.”

If one part of Farring’s call to action has come true, could the other?

If Last Hearth fell while Stannis, the Boltons, and the Manderlys battled to the south, the Weeper could attack White Harbor. 

This all depends on the Weeper and his men deciding to flee south instead of attacking the Night’s Watch and trying to become King Beyond the Wall, though. 

Since the Kingsroad is blocked by snow and the wildlings have few horses, they would follow the rivers and coasts. Jon contemplates the same course of action while planning a relief mission to Hardhome. 

&gt;When Satin left, Jon seated himself and had another look at the maps of the lands north of the Wall. The fastest way to Hardhome was along the coast … from Eastwatch. The woods were thinner near the sea, the terrain mostly flatlands, rolling hills, and salt marshes. And when the autumn storms came howling, the coast got sleet and hail and freezing rain rather than snow. The giants are at Eastwatch, and Leathers says that some will help. From Castle Black the way was more difficult, right through the heart of the haunted forest. If the snow is this deep at the Wall, how much worse up there?

The march would go uncontested since the Bolton, Umber, and Karstark armies are all to the west around Winterfell. The Weeper would pillage the North as he marched south, attacking White Harbor for food, plunder, and possibly, like Rorge at Saltpans in A Feast for Crows, a chance to escape the North by ship.

I understand that sounds unlikely, and it probably won’t happen, but I do think rogue groups of wildlings abandoning (or abandoned by) Mance could run amok in the exhausted North as the northmen fight each other. They could raid White Harbor, but I doubt they have the weapons to capture or sack a city.

**Dragons**

By this point, Stannis will have consolidated his hold on the North, dealt with the wildlings, and [distributed food from the captured Dreadfort to loyal houses](https://cantuse.wordpress.com/2014/10/08/the-dark-fortress/). Even with Winterfell captured and the return of Rickon, I doubt he will make that his seat. As we have seen in Theon’s chapters, [a ruined Winterfell is useless for surviving the winter](http://thelasthearth.com/thread/1240/iron-kings-great-victory-snow). Stannis will have two goals: to stabilize the Wall and reinforce it with his allies and prisoners, and to establish a foothold in the south so he can press his claim. To do either of these he will need White Harbor. Since winter has begun, the best way to transport armies will be by sea.

Stannis, with loans from the Iron Bank, will import food through White Harbor to feed the North. Since the wintertown and [Barrowton](https://cantuse.wordpress.com/2014/10/10/cinders-from-barrow-hall/) are burnt, White Harbor will be the best place for smallfolk to gather to survive the winter. Stannis must defend the city or lose the North.

If Stannis does press his claim in the south with the aid of the Manderly fleet, the vale would be his first target, since it is close to White Harbor by sea, has fresh troops, and has food supplies. For those same reasons, Daenerys will also want to recruit the kingdom to her cause.

Tyrion, for reasons of his own, could manipulate Daenerys into invading the vale.

&gt;“Tyrion was about to tell his lord father how he proposed to reduce the vale of Arryn to a smoking wasteland, but he was never given the chance.”

If Stannis and Daenerys do battle in the vale, would Daenerys really spare his staging point at White Harbor? What if Stannis, an able sea commander, destroyed her fleet? [What if he killed one of her dragons](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/87ut7g/spoilers_extended_the_winds_of_winter_outline_and/)?

**Snarks**

The snarks are mythical creatures used to taunt the Night’s Watch mission, but we as readers know the threat from beyond the Wall is very real. 

If the Others breach the Wall and attack the North, White Harbor would be one of the last points where the northmen have an organized resistance due to its food, population, ease of transport. It would also be a point for soldiers and smallfolk alike to flee. 

Would the Others attack the city to get more wights for their army? Or would they simply bypass it? Davos notes that White Harbor’s,

&gt;“firth had remained free of ice even in the depths of winter for centuries.”

So if this winter is exceptionally cold, whoever was left there could see themselves besieged and cut off from the sea to starve.

**Stannis**

How would Stannis defend White Harbor and the North now that dragons and Others have emerged?

When Davos treats with Lord Manderly, Ser Marlon says, 

&gt;“He offers us defeat and death. He would have you mount a horse of air and give battle with a sword of wind.”

As with everything else dismissed by the Manderlys, maybe these weapons should be considered as well?

A “horse of air” could mean Melisandre’s ability to summon winds for quick voyages.

And “sword of wind” could mean the [use of this spell as a weapon](https://cantuse.wordpress.com/2015/04/06/eye-of-the-storm/).

I hate to use an idea given to us by the show, but could these same spells be used to melt snow and ice surrounding White Harbor and make an escape possible, or even to drive away or weaken the Others?

Or could a “horse of air” and “sword of wind” point to Melisandre’s shadowbinding abilities? Conjuring mounts and weapons out of the air is quite similar to what Melisandre does using shadows and blood.

0,1,0,8,15,"Reading Fire and Blood there is one episode that really stands out: the death of Aerea was really well-written and chilling. So here is my proposal: if Martin is so much fed up with the main series, but he wants to add to the world of ASOIAF, he should write next a novella about the failed expedition of Gerion Lannister to Valyria. Martin is pretty good with horror, Nightflyers and Fevre Dream come to my mind as examples, and even if the main story does not advance at least we get the gruesome death of some relatable characters, and chilling lovecraftian horrors. That's more satisfying than fake history in my opinion, especially that of the Targaryens.",1,(Spoilers Published) Modest proposal,660,36
0,1,0,21,29,"**Aegon's Reign:** utterly boring. The Conquest is mildly interesting but it's not even new to this book so we're left with the Dornish War- just people we don't care about dying in increasingly horrible ways- and some people building a wall. Aegon remains the least interesting Targ king with the least interesting reign.

**Aenys and Maegor's reigns:** Again, we've already seen it and it wasn't very good the first time. 

**Jaehaerys's reign:** Really good. Deciding what to do with Maegor's supporters, the power struggle with Rogar, the death of Aerea... it's the best part of the book by a far margin. Aerea's death is actually the only thing I'd say the ""fake history"" framing device actually enhances- it reads like Ye Olde SCP or something, and the effect is really chilling. Having no wars means the characters mostly stick around long enough for us to actually know them. I do have a few issues- the battle with the Vulture King is given basically no build up and truly feels like filler- are we really meant to give a damn that Borys Baratheon betrayed his brother for no given reason? Whatever. 

**Viserys's reign:** Literally exists solely to prop up the Dance of the Dragons. I feel like it's the storytelling equivalent of the wife who dies to motivate the hero. Like, SOME identity outside of ""impending succession crisis"" would be nice. 

**The Dance:** Again, we've seen a lot of it, and what's new isn't particularly good compared to the stuff in TPATQ. Aemond killing all the Strongs feels like an utter contrivance to wipe out the house. I will say that Criston Cole's death is now redeemed in my eyes, instead of just being a ""Oh yeah he's dead"" in the Abridged version.  

**Aegon II:** No strong feelings about this one. It's the weakest of the new content, IMO, mainly because Aegon II isn't that well defined outside of ""bit of an arsehole"". Seeing Alfred Broome get his comeuppance is satisfying, I'll give GRRM that, but are people really going to watch him squirm about on a pole for two days?

**Aegon III:** The Peake Coup is as good as the Jaehaerys stuff, even if the resolution felt a bit weak (""Hey, Marston, can you stop trying to seize power?"" ""...Oh, go on, then,"" followed by everything immediately collapsing) but it does drag a bit in the middle. I was hoping for more power plays between the regents, but instead it all comes down to Unwin. Everything with Viserys II in it is excellent, he's quickly becoming one of my favorite historical characters. 

Other assorted notes:

Why does George keep introducing us to new Kingsguard who never get mentioned again? We'll get an expodump with all their names, perhaps one will die in the next fifty pages or so, and the next time we see a Kingsguard it's a completely different guy we've never seen before. 

Maester Smike is the worst ""slightly altered name"" we've gotten yet. Mike with an S on the front. Genius.

I like the name Maester Ryben, since I once wrote a fantasy novel with a protagonist called Lord Edward Ryben. In hindsight, it was absolute crap, but I still think the ending is pretty damn good for something I came up with when I was seventeen. 

I'm pretty sure Jordan Tower is the name of the broadcasting station from V for Vendetta, so I have no idea why GRRM named a character that. Maegor Towers and Rhaena Targaryen becoming friends is genuinely sweet, though. 

WTF did Septon Bernard do to deserve getting fucking castrated? Just seems so pointlessly harsh considering he didn't really do anything other than vaguely work for the bad guy.

WAAAY too many ""Conflict over, what do we do with the surviving culprits?"" arcs. Happens at least three times, which wouldn't be so bad if they weren't the exact same fucking thing each time: [new king] sentences [surviving baddies] to death, then someone suggests they get sent to the wall, so the King agrees, but one of the [surviving baddies] decides he (ALWAYS a he) would rather die, and thus is executed, and another person says he wants a trial by combat, which he inevitably loses. Tyrion must be the only person to actually win one of the damn things in history. Please also note that the first group of baddies sent to the wall stage an insurrection and get Lord Stark killed, yet this is never brought up any of the other times. 

Also, sticking to that theme, why is it that the two Kingsguard who betrayed the obviously evil king are the ones who betray the Watch? Just seems like such an odd choice.

Still no good characters named Edwyn. Still hoping out for a Tully... Joffrey got redeemed and then some with Doggett and Arryn, at least. 

When I read Sons of the Dragon, I thought that Rhaena marrying Androw was going to be a genuinely nice ending for her... then he turned out to be literally the most useless person ever before turning into Elliot Rodger? What? Still not sure how I feel about that. 

Why is it Jonah Mooton and Roy Connington are given the relatively-minor punishment of marrying one of the girls they banged, but the Stinger gets either death or getting all his arms and legs broken? Yeah, he was worse than the others, but it feels like such a massive disparity. 

The best moments in Fire and Blood are when GRRM actually takes the time to set up a scene instead of just telling us what happened in passing. This is possibly the most pathetic attempt at analysis yet, since all I've actually said is ""writing an actual novel is better than glorified cliff-notes"", but it's the closest I get to an actual point so I'll leave at the end.

I was always a crazy fan of the show, but stopped watching halfway through Season 5 when they completely slaughtered Sansa's character by marrying her to Ramsay &amp; using that rape scene as a plot device (I still have feeling about this). I knew that it happened differently in the books, and that a lot of other things I hated about the show were also absent from the books, so I put my limited-hours-on-earth where my mouth is and dropped the show to start working my way through the books...

* I think it is a very popular endgame theory which is so widely accepted among the fandom that it won't feel holy shit for many regulars of ASOIAF forums. I think this event is (partially or fully) burning of King's Landing, destroying the Red Keep and the Iron Throne in the process. We know this as the Mad Queen theory.

* If we can erase all of our ASOIAF memory and start the books/show from the beginning, we will see that the endgame has always been advertised by teasing ""Who will win the Game of Thrones? Who will sit on the Iron Throne at the end?"" Most of GoT's promotion from the earliest seasons to the latest #ForTheThrone hashtag prove this. Even GRRM is not exempt from this promotion strategy because he always keeps saying he knows who will be sitting on the Iron Throne at the end. 

* With this perspective, the great twist, the pulling the rug under moment, has always been to show that no one will sit on the damn thing because it will be destroyed in fire and blood. This will be the ultimate message to the audience. Normally, it would work as a great twist but since the book series is taking so long and the subtle setup/foreshadowing for this ending was thoroughly picked up by the readers, it won't feel overwhelming for forum veterans.

0,1,0,2,43,"This post will explore the following topics while basing the long night as a mini ice age:

* The geography of Westeros - and the historical evidence
* Ramifications to the plotline of ASOIAF
* Geopolitical consequences

# The Bering land bridge

The [Bering bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia) was a land connection between Asia and North America during the most recent ice age, that men used to migrate to the Americas around 13,000 years ago. At the end of the ice age, the sea level rose, and the Bering bridge was submerged.

What does this have to do with ASOIAF, you ask?, Well...

# The Neck, and the Arm of Dorne

It has been alluded to, in TWOIAF, that the region separating the North from the remaining kingdoms, called the ""Neck"", was flooded as an act of defence by the Children of the Forest (generating the geographical feature called the Bite). Similar things have been said about the so called ""Arm of Dorne"", a land bridge connecting Westeros to Essos, a feature now drowned and broken into the war-torn Stepstones.

**Assertion:** The submergence of the neck and the breaking of the Arm of Dorne were consequences of the ending of *a* Long night. Many facts can be explained simply by increasing or decreasing sea levels.

#Implications

**Q:** But, but, the First Men arrived at Westeros by crossing the Arm of Dorne! How is this possible, if the Arm is only 'connected' during the Long night?  
**A:** When the first men crossed the Arm of Dorne, it *was* a Long night on Planetos. Think about it. Were it otherwise, why did the FM wait so long to cross? I think the crossing was only motivated by FM seeking warmer lands, such as Dorne, to escape the winter-hit north of Essos. (Note: This would be a Long Night before the Wall was built, most likely)
  

**Q:** During the Long night that came after the FM invaded, did the Arm of Dorne not reconnect?  
**A:** Oh, yes, it did. And that is how our favourite Last Hero / Prince that was promised / Azor Ahai made it from Essos to Westeros. Again, I like this interpretation, because it makes a lot of sense. The PtwP probably made it to Westeros with an army or two, and helped repel the Others. This explains how a popular Essosi legend (think Nissa Nissa, Rhllorian beliefs, etc) connects to a warrior fighting somewhere near the Wall in Westeros. They probably also set up House Dayne, the foundations of Battle Isle, etc. This 'Second Invasion' predates the Andals, and is not remembered because, as GRRM goes to great lengths to remind us, the First Men kept no records! It's possible that the CoTF remember, and this might be revealed through a Bran chapter soon.

**Q:** What does that mean for the story now?  
**A:** A lot actually. If the story happened this way earlier, it can happen again. The newly connected Arm of Dorne will provide an easy way for Danaerys to bring her to-be gigantic *Khalasar* from Westeros to Essos. I don't think there's any other way to ferry *all the Dothraki* from one continent to another. Further, if the neck widens, as expected, it will make conquest of the North much easier than it currently is: All the power of the crannongmen and Moat Cailin will not count at all.

Further, a connected Arm of Dorne makes it impossible for ships to move from the west of Westeros to the east, as they usually do. Fleets will no longer move from, say, the Arbor,or Oldtown, to places like Dragonstone. Will this be significant for the story? I mean, how many ships do we expect to even move around in the heart of winter? I don't know.

**Q:** What else?  
**A:** If, for instance, the Iron Islands get connected to the mainlands during the Long Night, it explains a lot of the history of the Ironborn. It explains how 'weird' structures like the Seastone chair appeared (the same people who built the foundations of the Hightower - the Second Invaders). Further, this interpretation would provide clues to the ending: Maybe Westeros is doomed to a series of ice ages, and each happens so long after the other that the information is always lost. This is very similar to Asimov's *Nightfall*, a bittersweet ending, as promised.",1,[Spoilers Extended] The long night and the Ice age,4144,50
0,1,0,50,117,"Toward the end of A Feast for Crows, there are two scenes in which Grandmaester Pycelle publicly admits to providing Queen Margaery with moon tea, implying that she is having an affair with someone. I've been thinking about these scenes a lot recently, and there are a lot of things that, fairly obviously, don't make any sense. Why would the intelligent and supposedly pious Margaery be having an affair? Why would she go to Pycelle for moon tea when he is so likely to betray her? Why would the Lannister-loyal Pycelle withhold this information for so long, only revealing it under duress? Others have theorized that Margaery may have needed the moon tea for someone else, or some reason other than contraception, but I think the answer is a lot simpler. Margaery never asked Pycelle for moon tea. Pycelle is lying.

Margaery has consistently been characterized as clever, pious and good-hearted throughout the series. Is cheating on the literal King of Westeros really the course of action someone with these traits would follow? While this whole persona might just be a ruse, such a deep deception would be impractical for almost anyone, particularly someone of her age and experience. If she needed moon tea for someone else or some other reason, it still doesn't make any sense for her to approach Pycelle. We're distinctly told that Margaery brought her own private maester with her to King's Landing when we are told of her plans to send him to help Loras on Dragonstone. Surely something as commonplace and basic as moon tea could be supplied by this maester instead, without as high a risk of this being revealed. Hell, any random apothecary in the city would be less likely to betray her than Pycelle, because...

Pycelle has been proven to be a loyal servant of House Lannister several times, routinely betraying enemies of the House in order to further its goals. Despite his frequent clashes with Cersei, he always tries to remain polite, offers her good advice and works to promote her interests, however misguided those may be. Since the removal of the Tyrells from power is very clearly what Cersei wants, it would make perfect sense for him to just lie to further Cersei's interests, while hopefully furthering her faith in him. Since Pycelle is not the bravest of men, he could also have just told Cersei what she wanted to hear just to get her off his back, perhaps in tandem with the other reasons.

**TLDR;** Pycelle outright lied about giving Margaery moon tea in an attempt to curry favor with Cersei, and further the cause of House Lannister.",1,[Spoilers Main] A Pycelle/Margaery Theoryish Thing,2567,50

0,1,0,18,19,"In ACOK, Big Walder gets in a fight with Little Walder about succession. Little Walder points out that neither of them will inherit the Twins. Big Walder responds by saying that he will be Lord of the Twins one day. On the surface, this is a bold statement. There are literally branches of House Frey that will have to die out or be disinherited before Big Walder can inherit the Twins. However, remember that Big Walder is a Blackwood Frey and that his uncle is Lothar Frey, the steward of the Twins. There's been some speculation amongst fans that Lothar will try to seize the Twins in the upcoming Frey Civil War. The books even seem to suggest that Lothar is planning something.

So, if Lothar is planning to usurp the Twins, than Big Walder moves up the line of succession by a lot. Big Walder's dad, Jammos Frey, is the second son of Walder's Blackwood bride. Now Lothar has only daughters. It's not clear what kind of succession rules House Frey follows. Under First Men succession laws, an uncle cannot inherit before a daughter, but since the Freys came much later, I'm guessing they don't follow those laws. In that case, Big Walder is next in line to inherit the Twins after his father.

Now the question arrises, how did Big Walder find out? One possibility is that Big Walder simply deduced that Lothar would take over the Twins. This seems a little hard to swallow. Sure, he's a bright boy, but he's only nine. It's a bit of a stretch to think he worked it all out by himself. Another possibility is that Lothar told Walder, but why would Lothar do that? Well, Lothar isn't going to let his daughters get disinherited. However, he knows he can't have another succession dispute right after he usurped the Twins. One thing he can do to prevent this is to marry his eldest daughter to Big Walder. That way his daughters get to inherit and Jammos is pleased. I suspect that Lothar worked out this plan with Jammos, who told his son.

**Tl;DR:** Big Walder knows that Lothar plans to usurp the Twins and was told about it by either Lothar or Jammos, because he'll be the heir if that happens.",1,(Spoilers Extended) Big Walder Knows about Lothar's plan,2102,56

(Or so you hope.)

Really, though, paging through *Fire &amp; Blood* just now, I'm finding myself honestly and to my great surprise *super* stoked about it. Like… *way* more excited than I was when I got AWOIAF, for whatever reason. Maybe because this one looks more like an actual ""book-book""? Maybe because the scope necessarily indicates a greater depth of detail and more potential for deliciously pregnant choices of verbiage? Maybe because some of the art pieces I glanced held out the promise of learning a *lot* more useful stuff than many/most assumed we'd learn?

I dunno. Sure, I'd preordered it and was ""excited"" to get it in an ""on paper"" sense of the word, but I am simultaneously embarrassed and proud to say that as of opening the box from (stupid fucking) amazon, pulling out F&amp;B and flipping through it I got as giddy as I've been about ASOIAF since ADWD was released.

0,1,0,2,6,"What happened to all of the Florent men?

After the Blackwater, Davos asks:

&gt;""Did none keep faith?"" he asked. ""Some few,"" the captain said. ""The queen's kin, them in chief. We took off many who wore the fox-and-flowers, though many more were left ashore, with all manner of badges. Lord Florent is the King's Hand on Dragonstone now.""

And he hears the same from Alester Florent.

&gt;Lord Alester waved his hand feebly. ""Lord Celtigar was captured and bent the knee. Monford Velaryon died with his ship, the red woman burned Sunglass, and Lord Bar Emmon is fifteen, fat, and feeble. Those are your lords of the narrow sea. Only the strength of House Florent is left to Stannis, against all the might of Highgarden, Sunspear, and Casterly Rock, and now most of the storm lords as well.""

&gt;Ser Axell proposed to use Salladhor Saan's fleet and the men who had escaped the Blackwater—Stannis still had some fifteen hundred on Dragonstone, more than half of them Florents—to exact retribution for Lord Celtigar's defection.

I'm not sure if Jon saw the Florent banner in the battle beneath the Wall, it was windy. The common men may have chosen Stannis' sigil due to their religious furor.

&gt;More and more men were pouring from the trees, not only knights now but freeriders and mounted bowmen and men-at-arms in jacks and kettle helms, dozens of men, hundreds of men. A blaze of banners flew above them. The wind was whipping them too wildly for Jon to see the sigils, but he glimpsed a seahorse, a field of birds, **a ring of flowers**. And yellow, so much yellow, yellow banners with a red device, whose arms were those?

But later Sam sees the Florent banner when he arrives at Castle Black.

&gt;There was a king in the King's Tower for the first time in living memory, and banners flew from the Lance, Hardin's Tower, the Grey Keep, the Shieldhall, and other buildings that had stood empty and abandoned for long years. ""The big one, the gold with the black stag, that's the royal standard of House Baratheon,"" he told Gilly, who had never seen banners before. ""The fox-and-flowers is House Florent. The turtle is Estermont, the swordfish is Bar Emmon, and the crossed trumpets are for Wensington.""

That means that while the notable Florents, Axell and Selyse, remained at Eastwatch, some Florent knights or troops are in Stannis' host.

But I searched the Asha chapters in A Dance with Dragons, and the Florents are not mentioned once. Instead we hear about a bunch of knights and stormlords, each with their own squires and attendants. So what happened to the Florent troops, were they spread out under the command of knights and lords who lost all of their men? If they still were a cohesive unit, you think Stannis would want to have their commander in his councils, since he commands half of the southrons, about one tenth of his army. I'm not trying to imply anything, I don't think there's a hidden force of Florents out there, I'm just wondering why George seems to have forgotten about this house.",1,Florents (Spoilers Published),3019,29

0,1,0,123,225,"Ever since ASoS (at least), there's been speculation that George has reworked the timeline of **ASoIaF** to something a bit less insane than was originally presented back in AGoT. In his new interview, George seemingly confirms this:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; “10,000 years” is mentioned in the novels. But you also have places where maesters say, “No, no, it wasn’t 10,000, it was 5,000.” Again, I’m trying to reflect real-life things that a lot of high fantasy doesn’t reflect. In the Bible, it has people living for hundreds of years and then people added up how long each lived and used that to figure out when events took place. Really? I don’t think so. Now we’re getting more realistic dating now from carbon dating and archeology. But Westeros doesn’t have that. They’re still in the stage of “my grandfather told me and his grandfather told him.” So I think it’s closer to 5,000 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Going back to AGoT, that novel presented a clear timeline for events: the First Men invaded Westeros 12,000 years ago, the Long Night and War for the Dawn was 8,000 years ago, the Andal Invasion was 6,000 years ago and so on. This was clear, but also unrealistic, since it would make the Wall twice as old as the Pyramids and the Andal Invasion would be so long ago that all ethnic and cultural differences between the Andals and the First Men would have been long lost and certainly no longer A Thing.

Starting in ASoS, when Sam expresses doubt that Jon really is the 998th Lord Commander, it feels like George has been slowly backtracking on the traditional dates. This continued in ADWD, when dates for the Andal Invasion are thrown around from 4,000 to 2,000 years. In various statements over the years George has also grumbled about the dates, noting he vagued them up because people on forums (specifically Elio) kept pointing out flaws in them, and that he considers the earliest ""reliable"" date being when the Daynes got their hands on Dawn, which was about 2,000 years ago (weirdly, some material published since then suggests that the Daynes got Dawn more like 10,000 years ago, just to keep things confused).

The statements in the interview above, which suggests that the Long Night was more like 5,000 years than 10,000 years ago, seems to back this up, and furthers my idea that GRRM has privately halved all the backstory dates from his original AGoT plan.

On this basis everything works better: the First Men invaded Westeros 6,000 years ago. The Long Night and the War for the Dawn was about 4,000 years ago, making the Wall about as old as the Pyramids (or maybe somewhat younger). The Andals invaded Westeros between 2,000 and 3,000 years ago, about as remote as the age of the early Roman Republic or the classical Greek period. Valyria was founded around 3,000 years ago. Dates then lock in with the established chronology around the founding of Lorath and before the Rhoynar Wars.

0,1,0,83,39,"I was listening to the Not A Podcast (the one where Bfish endlessly hates on Catelyn Stark) and they discussed the theory that LF might have been the one to spread the idea that Lyanna was kidnapped by Rhaegar to induce Brandon's machismo overload to get him killed. I think this interpretation of the theory was rightfully because it just makes LF a little too OP especially while still relatively young.

\- but -

The more I think about it, the more I actually think it's the perfect GRRM ""twist"" and it actually can be explained much more believably if it's just framed a little differently.

**TL;DR I think there's a strong chance that LF would have told Brandon the kidnapping story not as part of some grand scheme but purely to piss Brandon off and the way the events snowballed would have been something he never could have anticipated. Once LF saw the huge effect his words had, though, it was like a serial killer having his first kill. It almost makes way too much sense with the symmetry of the story.**

From a number of different angles, this works so smoothly. Let's just compare what happened with LF/Cat/Brandon and how the truth around the Lyanna story turns that Lyanna/Rhaegar/Robert story into a strange mirroring of events.

LF thought Catelyn was ""stolen"" from him by Brandon. He hated Brandon for that. Catelyn was very clearly not interested in LF like he was with her. In his mind, he created a fantasy of love and partnership and passion that just wasn't there. He duels Brandon for Catelyn's hand, even though Catelyn never really had any interest in LF's hand and gave Brandon her favor. LF sees himself as being the one defending Catelyn's virtue in this instance - and he loses.

**Compare this with the basic premise of the Robert/Lyanna/Rhaegar triangle:**

Robert thought Lyanna was ""stolen"" from him by Rhaegar. He hated Rhaegar for that. Lyanna was very clearly not interested in Robert like he was with her. In his mind, he created a fantasy of love and partnership and passion that just wasn't there. He duels Rhaegar for Lyanna's hand, even though Lyanna never really had any interest in Robert's hand and ran away with Rhaegar. Robert sees himself as being the one defending Lyanna's virtue in this instance - except unlike LF, he wins.

**Here's the weirdest third layer...because there's a similarity in how this situation is framed for Brandon/Lyanna/Rhaegar:**

Brandon thought Lyanna was ""stolen"" from his family by Rhaegar. He hated Rhaegar for that. Lyanna was probably not stolen away though and not interested in Robert like he was with her. In Robert's mind, he created a fantasy of love and partnership and passion that just wasn't there. Brandon sees himself as being the one defending Lyanna's virtue in this instance when he rides to KL. He intends to duel Rhaegar for Lyanna, even though Lyanna never really had any interest in Robert's hand and ran away with Rhaegar. Brandon very publicly dies as a result. He never gets the duel.

**Here's why I think it almost HAD to be Littlefinger's doing:**

* There's a serious disconnect in the two version of the Lyanna story - indicating that it's important that there are two very different versions of the story.
* There's a serious disconnect in how LF perceived the confrontation with Brandon from what actually was happening that really looks like the same case for Robert. LF feels like Cat was stolen and feels righteous for going after Brandon like Robert feels like Lyanna was stolen by Rhaegar and feels righteous for actually killing him.
* Brandon was the powder keg the set the last series of events in motion - and we still don't yet know how exactly he came to believe that Lyanna was kidnapped which makes me guess that it's important how that info was transmitted.
* Would it not seem really, really, really plausible that LF was young, angry, and jaded by his confrontation with Brandon that he'd do something very bad and impulsive? I think yes. So he basically tries to make Brandon feel how he felt during the Catelyn ""duel"" by making Brandon believe his little sister was kidnapped (taken wrongfully) and horrifyingly raped.
* We know LF is capable of this type of lie anyway.
* It also doesn't require that LF be some manipulative mastermind genius game player, it only requires that he wants Brandon to feel pain and anger.
* This smaller event sparking a gigantic conflict is GRRM-like in the way that the assassination of Franz Ferdinand was the tipping point for WWI which makes it an appealing possibility.

And, lastly and I think maybe most profoundly -

**It totally ties together Ned Stark's story. Ned's life would be shown to have been so profoundly affected by this without his ever really knowing.**

Think about all of this;

* Littlefinger would have spread the lie that got Brandon and Rickard killed brutally (along with a lot of other people);
* Ned was the one who picked up the pieces in the betrothal between Brandon and Catelyn by stepping in for Brandon and marrying Catelyn - but proving himself to be a loyal and loving husband to her.
* The lie which sparked the conflict that ultimately claimed Rhaegar's life and (it's hard to point to any obvious causation but the correlation) Lyanna was what also laid the foundation for Ned to step into their shoes as a parent when he took in Jon Snow as his son.
* Everything Ned treasured (his family and his desire to be a worthy lord) would have come from his **positively** reacting to the terrible and evil manipulations of Littlefinger.

I could easily see Littlefinger continuing to hate Ned Stark for this. Essentially because Ned is just ***being good***. Imagine LF watching Ned from afar and knowing how the perception of him around the kingdom is so high and how Ned has basically everything LF wanted. (shades of Stannis also being jealous of the way Ned was loved by Robert)

\*edit\* There's so much added irony in LF hating Ned for benefiting unintentionally from all of LF's maneuvering.

As a result, Littlefinger sets out by killing the man who was like a father to Ned and luring him into a situation where LF could destroy him. Now that Ned is gone, LF believes he's won. He's eliminated Ned and Brandon. He even now has Sansa as his stand-in for Cat. He thinks he's conquered the Stark ghost that's been continually foiling every dream he's made for himself. He wanted to punish Ned most of all. It makes Littlefinger as petty as I think he is. He's the type of villain who wants to destroy the hero just because the hero is *good*. I think this much more clearly defines LF's motivations rather than casting him as a simple *Betrayus Ex Machina*.

**And my, oh my, how much more ultimately satisfying for Sansa to be the one to lead to his demise under this context.**",1,"(Spoilers Extended) Connecting Littlefinger to the ""Lyanna was kidnapped"" story",6783,79

About WoW:

&gt;I know there are a lot of people out there who are very angry with me that *Winds of Winter* isn’t finished. And I’m mad about that myself. I wished I finished it four years ago. **I wished it was finished now. But it’s not.** And I’ve had dark nights of the soul where I’ve pounded my head against the keyboard and said, “God, will I ever finish this? The show is going further and further forward and I’m falling further and further behind. What the hell is happening here? I’ve got to do this.”

About possible hints for ASOIAF on Fire and Blood:

&gt;There are a few that are definitely important, but I’m not going to flag them. Readers will have to find them and puzzle out whether they’re hints or red herrings.

0,1,0,75,226,"So let me just preface this by saying I started with the shows then read all of the asoiaf books and now I’ve finished the Tales, I’ve started learning the lore of the series and am in love with all of the magic. I’ve never really seen a “plot hole” (this isn’t much of a plot hole just something that seems implausible). I’m a huge fan of the series but one thing just doesn’t make sense in these short stories. 

In the first book, at the tourney of Ashford, Dunk has to go to a trial by 7 with 6 knights against Aerion and his knights. Dunk’s 6 are newly knighted Ser Raymun Fossoway, Ser Humfhrey Beesbury, Ser Humfrey Harding, Ser Lyonel Baratheon, Dunk himself, and Ser Robyn Rhysling (that’s 6). And he has to beg the crowd full of bystanders to have another champion.  Baelor “Breakspear” Targaryen (heir to the throne) ends up being his 7th champion. 

They fight and both of the Humfreys die, Dunk almost dies. They go back to the tent and the rest are checking on Dunk when Baelor asks to have someone help with his helmet because he’s feeling woozy. It turns out his head is caved in and the only thing keeping him alive was his helmet holding his brain in his head. So now 3 noble lords are dead one of them is the very beloved heir to the throne. All 7 of these people on his side are from different parts of Westeros and there are a bunch more lords in attendance all from all over Westeros. 

So my only confusion is, whenever he introduces himself as Ser Duncan the Tall, how does not everyone know who he is almost immediately? That story should be in everyone’s ears. Story tellers, singers, Dwarf troops, etc would all be showing this. Every Inn, Brothel, Pub, Wine Sink, etc would’ve spreading this story more than Bloody Flux did in Astapor. As much as people are complaining about Blackfyre related stuff, this should be the talk of the entire country. Some random hedge knight beat the shit out of a prince, twice. Had to fight a trial by 7 against Kingsguard and 3 Targaryen princes. Three of the Lord’s of fairly decent sized/wealthy houses die, one of them being the crown prince. How the *hell* doesn’t everyone just hear his name and bring up the tourney and trial? It’s the one thing I can’t believe. Some people do know who he is, I believe Maynard Plum tells him some people blame him for the troubles. But there shouldn’t be a time where people hear his name and don’t say something to him. That’s like not knowing who Ned Stark is and how he’s a “traitor” in the asoiaf series or the Joffrey was killed at his wedding. News spreads incredibly fast in Westeros and Ser Duncan the Tall and the tourney at Ashford should be in everyone’s recent memory. 

Great books other than this minor thing that I was thinking about, I think the relationship between Dunk and Egg is great. I can’t wait for Winds and the next Tale to come out. 
",1,[SPOILERS PUBLISHED] I Just finished the Tales of Dunk and Egg and there’s one thing I can’t seem to believe,2864,108
0,1,0,266,332," In ACOK when Daenerys learns about the death of Robert Baratheon and is told that Eddard Stark may have had a hand in killing him, Jorah Mormont immediately dismisses the idea of Ned forsaking his honor by saying -

&gt;*""Ned Stark a traitor?"" Ser Jorah snorted. ""Not bloody likely. The Long Summer will come again before that one would besmirch his precious honor.""*   

While Dany believes it for possible truth by saying – 

&gt;*""What honor could he have?"" Dany said. ""He was a traitor to his true king, as were these Lannisters.""*

It’s not surprising though for Daenerys to think this way about Eddard Stark considering how Viserys himself described him to Dany as *“cold-eyed Eddard Stark with his frozen heart”.* Only after Ser Barristan reveals to her the truth about her father in ASOS does Dany starts to see just how misinformed she has been all this time.

&gt;*The old knight did not blink. ""Your father is called 'the Mad King' in Westeros. Has no one ever told you?""*   
&gt;  
&gt;*""Viserys did."" The Mad King. ""The Usurper called him that, the Usurper and his dogs."" The Mad King. ""It was a lie.""*

We too fall victim to the false information we receive by unreliable narration, and take the false opinions of POV characters as facts instead of what they really are: false opinions.

I for one fell victim to Tyrion’s opinion on Mace Tyrell in *Tyrion III ASOS*

*Tyrell's* *reputation* *rested on one indecisive victory over Robert Baratheon at Ashford, in a battle largely won by Lord Tarly's van before the main host had even arrived.* ***The siege of Storm's End, where Mace Tyrell actually did hold the command, had dragged on a year to no result, and after the Trident was fought, the Lord of Highgarden had meekly dipped his banners to Eddard Stark.***

I take no credit for figuring this out, but someone pointed out to me that Mace Tyrell’s siege of Storm’s End was handled smartly. Had Robert's Rebellion failed and the Mad King kept his seat, Mace keeps his head on his shoulders. Had Robert won, the chances of him being pardoned with very little consequences increase because he neither harmed the castle walls nor spilled the blood of Roberts brothers - Stannis and Renly.

There are many instances where GRRM uses unreliable narration as misdirection to hide in plain sight the very subtle or obvious truth.

**What are some of those moments when you figured out that the truth is different then what the dialogue or inner monologue of the characters imply?**

2. **The Red Wedding**  
The Red Wedding is the most well known chapter in the entire book series. Everybody knows who died at the Wedding, but when you ask **who did it?** you get weird answers: The Freys, the Boltons, parts of the Karstarks, the Lannisters helped. But this isn't very narrowed down so here are the people who helped directly at the Red Wedding on the Frey side.   
Wives and children of the men bellow probably were at the Wedding, but because they hold little to no power or are kids I excused them.  


Red Wedders who payed for their sins:  
**Ryman Frey: Ryman played a key role in the Wedding. Apparently he is one of the main planners and he leads the attack in the diner room. He is seen killing Dacey Mormont.**  
Petyr ""Pimple"" Frey: Petyr started drinking with the Greatjon. He passed out drunk and slept through the entire Wedding  
Rhaegar Frey: Unknown how he was involved but he was a disgusting dick to Davos, Manderly and his granddaughter  
Jared Frey: Unknown how he was involved but he was telling lot's of lies to the Merman Court and tried to get Davos killed.  
Tytos Frey: Killed by Sandor Clegane at the Red Wedding  
Garse Goodbrook: Killed by the camps during the Red Wedding  
Aenys Frey: Participates in the Red Wedding  
Symond Frey: Treasurer and spymaster at the Twins, unknown but expected involvement  
Merrett Frey: Drank himself to sleep and missed the whole Red Wedding  
Benfrey Frey: Died of a wound received at the Red Wedding  


Red Wedders who are still unpunished:  
**Walder Frey: The patriach is obviously heavily involved in the Red Wedding**  
Edwyn Frey: The one who gets slapped by Caitlyn for wearing mail  
""Black"" Walder Frey: Kills a Vance at the Red Wedding  
Leslyn Haigh, Harys Haigh, Donnel Haigh: the Haighs are extremely loyal bannermen to the Freys, the Haighs all fight in the diner room where Leslyn loses an ear to the Greatjon.  
Hosteen Frey: Kills Lucas Blackwood  
Danwell Frey: Drinks with Marq Piper who is captured alive  
Raymund Frey: Kills Caitlyn  
**""Lame"" Lothar Frey: The main planner of the Red Wedding. Basically arranged it, gave people tasks and made Rains of Castamere the signal.**  
Jammos Frey: Involved but unknown how  
Whalen Frey: Tried to kill Grey Wind but Raynald Westerling caught his axe. Raynald Westerling then fell into the river and is never seen again.  
**Bastard Walder Rivers: Leads the attack on the camps**  
Lucias Vypren: Present but involvement unknown  
Damon Vypren: Present but involvement unknown  
Dafyn Vance: Possibly present because his daughter was presented to Robb Stark  


Possibly present but no noted involvement:  
Walton Frey  
Arwood Frey  
Ser Theo Frey  
Ronel Rivers  
Martyn Rivers: Best scout after Blackfish and supported Robb heavily  
Ryger Rivers: Really friendly towards Caitlyn

So these are the men who were involved in the wedding. If you should hate Freys hate these Freys, especially the marked ones. The rest of the people at the Red Wedding were: Kids, women and bannermen who operated under orders (what else could they do) So next time judge the people who should be judged.  


3. **Meet the Freys**  
This is what this post was mostly about. Giving the Freys some personality, they are not a united family that works towards the same goals. Many Freys hate each other and there are some big hints that their might be an upcoming Frey civil war. So I wrote this about the different Frey factions and who are the different individual Freys.So when you eventually read the Winds of Winter you will know who to root for and who to dislike.  


Walder Frey. Everybody knows Walder, he is a weasel like (and so are all his kin), heh laughing man who has had 8 wives who were all younger than him. He has an army from his trousers. I won't waste more words on him because everybody already knows Walder.  


Faction 0: The Royce Freys

The Royce Freys are not really a faction since their families are really splintered. They don't work well with each other and don't get along well.  
~~Stevron Frey~~: The only notable member that could be considered part of the Royce Freys would be Stevron Frey. Stevron was the heir to the twins for 65 years. He was raised to care for his entire family like Walder and was generally a good guy. He died in his sleep after a battle during the war of 5 kings.  


Faction 1: The Alfa Freys - the terrible family  
The Alfa Freys are decedents by Stevron Frey and his first wife Corenna Swann.  
~~Ryman Frey~~: Stevron might have been a good guy himself but he didn't raise his first son very well. Ryman is a drunk, a douchebag and one of the main architect of the Red Wedding. He also doesn't care for his family. When his youngest son Petyr is kidnapped he isn't even disturbed by it. Ryman also planned on kicking a lot of his relatives out of the Twins. Luckily he died by the hands of the Brotherhood without Banners.  
Edwyn Frey: Ryman oldest son is a bit better than his father. He is smarter and doesn't get drunk on the daily. Edwyn is described as hateful and lying though. Not many people have something good to say about him. He is the current heir to the Twins.  
Jaynce Hunter is Edwyn wife and they got one daughter named Walda Frey but everybody believes that Black Walder is the true father.  
""Black"" Walder Frey: Black Walder is a fighter, he leads the main Frey contingent they goes with Robb and he scales walls. He is also a generally arsehole to everybody around him. He has an extremely hostile relationship with the brother Edwyn, sleeps with lots of women in the Twins and insults a lot of people. ""He didn't get his name from his black beard"" describes him pretty well.  
~~Petyr ""Pimple"" Frey~~: Generally a sad character. He is extremely ugly, even without his face full with red pimples. He gets married when he was a kid to a woman three times his age Mylenda Caron. She rejects him and instead sleeps with his mean brother Black Walder. Their daughter Perra (named after her great grandmother) is probably a bastard.  
Petyr gets bullied and is generally a disappointment so he chills more with other Freys at the twins. He seems to be drinking buddies with Merrett and Danwell. He died when he went whoring and got captured by the Brotherhood without Banners. Who hang him for his ""participation"" in the Red Wedding.  


Faction 2: The Lydden Freys - the Vances  
The Lydden Freys are descendants by Stevron Frey and his second wife Jeyne Lydden.  
~~Aegon ""Jinglebells"" Frey~~: Jinglebells was the mentally incapable son that was eventually killed by Caitlyn Stark at the Red Wedding.  
~~Maegelle Frey~~: Maegelle grew up normally and was married to Dafyn Vance, we don't know which Vance branch they are from. Maegelle died in childbed.  
Dafyn Vance: Dafyn is the reason why this group of ""Freys"" aren't really Freys. The Vance Freys are really Frey Vances. We don't know their relationship with the other Vances but presumably the Frey Vances were present during the Red Wedding in which we see at least one Vance die by Black Walders hands. So maybe they aren't on the best terms. Dafyn also choose his wives family over his own so maybe his is either a lowranking Vance or he liked the Freys better.  
We don't know anything really about the plans that Dafyn Vances has even if he has any but if Edwyn and Black Walder die, his family is heir to the Twins since Walda and Perra are probably bastards.His three children with Maegelle are: Marianne Vance, Walder Vance and Patrek Vance.  


Faction 3: The Waynwood Freys - the one with the Vale ties  
The Waynwood Freys are descendants by Stevron Frey and his third wife Marsella Waynwood.  
Walton Frey: Walton is the one child by Marsella Waynwood. The Waynwoods are one of the most prestigious houses of the Vale. We known little about Walton, we don't know if he fought in any battles, we don't even know if he was present at the Red Wedding. His daughter was, so presumably. Walton seems to have had a good relationship with his now dead mother since Walton married into a bannerman family of the Waynwoods.  
Deana Hardyng: Deana is a member of house Hardyng. The same house as Harry the Heir from the Vale is from. Deana seems to have a good relationship with Walton. He doesn't ""use"" her as a breeding horse and Walton was probably on good terms with the Waynwoods and Hardyngs. They have two sons and one daughters  
Bryan Frey and Steffon ""the Sweet"" Frey: Two sons of Walton, nothing is known about them.  
""Fair"" Walda Frey: The most beautiful girl of all the Freys. Maybe Hardyng blood makes people pretty.  


Faction 4: The Lannister Freys - the ones that supported the other side  
The Lannister Freys are descendants by Emmon Frey and Genna Lannister  
Emmon Frey: He went to Casterly Rock at age 14 which made Tywin really angry. He feared Tywin his entire life. He is a sullen and scared guy. He almost never dares to raise his voice against anybody. Emmon is the ""rightful"" ruler of Riverrun but not of the Riverlands.  
Genna Lannister: Genna is the real leader of the Lannister Freys. During the War of the 5 Kings Genna followed her family into the war and Emmon just went with it. Their children had lived their entire life at Casterly Rock so it is not that surprising. Genna seems a friendly and happy woman who makes easy talk with everybody.  
~~Cleos Frey~~: The poor captured Frey that was forced to go between the Starks and Lannisters peace talks. His wagon got attacked multiple times and eventually he had to travel with Jaime and Brienne. When he dies he doesn't even get a proper burial. Jaime eventually tells everyone he died a hero so at least he got that.  
Jenye Darry: Jeyne is the wife of Cleos Frey. She is furious that her children didn't get Darry when the male line of Darry died. Instead Darry was awarded to her older sisters line.  
Tywin Frey and Willem Frey: the two sons of Cleos and Jeyne. Ty is currently the heir to Riverrun but Genna and Jeyne rather wanted Darry since the Tully's are still around.  
Lyonel Frey, ~~Tion Frey~~, ""Red"" Walder Frey: The remaining sons of Genna and Emmon. Lyonel is married to Melesa Crakehall, Tion is killed by Rickard Karstark and Red Walder is a page at Casterly Rock.  


Faction 5: The Wylde Freys - the wormy Bolton allies  
The Wylde Freys are descendants by Aenys Frey and Tyana Wylde.  
~~Aenys Frey~~: Aenys is considered one of the more scheming Freys, he is often called a worm. He commands the Frey force that goes with Roose Bolton. Aenys ""gets captured"" to get into Harrenhall but it is a ruse to capture the castle. Aenys is then one of Roose's advisers. After the War of the 5 Kings Aenys leads 2000 Frey men towards the North. There he stays at Winterfell until he is expelled and riding to fight Stannis but he trips and dies.  
Aegon ""Bloodborn"" Frey: Aenys' oldest son turned outlaw and is now named Aegon Bloodborn.   
~~Rheagar Frey~~: Rheagar is one of the three Freys sent to the Merman court. There Rheagar tells all kinds of lies about the Red Wedding. He is kind of a nasty douche and also associated with worms. He might be alive but was probably turned into a pie.  
The remaining Wylde Freys are Jeyne Beesbury and her three children Robert, ""White"" Walda and Jonos Frey. The Wylde Freys  right now consist of an outlaw and a mother and her children. Not the best position.  


Faction 6: The Haigh Freys - the loyal bannermen  
The Haighs are descendants by Perriane Frey and Leslyn Haigh.  
Perriane Frey: Married to Leslyn, they got three sons and a grandson.  
Leslyn Haigh: They are loyal bannermen, which is not surprising since they are also married into the family by Walder. This would be a great honor for the Haighs. Because of this Leslyn leads his sons and man to participate in the Red Wedding. He loses an ear to the Greatjon.  
Harys, Donnel, Alyn and Walder Haigh: They all were at the Red Wedding and Harys is seen wrestling with a Vance. They all survive. The Haighs go to Saltpans to invest the raid that happened there.  
The Haighs don't seems to have any special business except following the Freys.  


Faction 7: The Swann Freys - the unlucky ones  
The Swann Freys are the descendants by Walder Frey and Cyrenna Swann.  
~~Jared Frey~~: Married to Alys Frey who is from a minor branch. Jared is arrogant and looks like a weasel with a mustache. He is captured by Tywin but then ransomed at Harrenhall. He travels to White Harbor and tells that Robb did the Red Wedding. When Davos calls him a liar he threatens to kill him. Jared presumably ends up in a pie.  
~~Tytos Frey~~: Son of Cyrenna and Jared. Tytos is killed by Sandor Clegane at the Red Wedding with an axe in his head.  
Zhoe Blanetree, Zia Frey and Zachery Frey: the wife and children of Tytos. It is unknown where they are now.  
~~Garse Goodbrook~~: The Goodbrooks have no reason to like the Tully's, during Robert Rebellion they supported the crown and for that Hoster Tully burned their lands. Goodbrooks also didn't support Robb Stark fully and fought with the Lannisters during the siege of Riverrun under Daven Lannister. Garse Goodbrooks was killed by Sandor Clegane while fighting in the camps.  
Kyra Frey: The daughter of Jared and Cyrenna married to Garse Goodbrook. They good two children Walder and Jeyne.  
Luceon Frey: Luceon is interesting because he is a Septon. And not just a Septon he is the Septon that almost got voted to High Septon but the High Sparrow deposed him.  


Faction 8: The Crakehall Freys - the bully boars, oafs, hogs and pigs  
The Crakehall Freys are descendants by Walder Frey and Amarei Crakehall.  
Hosteen Frey: Ser Stupid. Hosteen is the best fighter of the Freys. He is strong and quick to angry. In short he is a typical Crakehall. All the Crakehall Freys are really similar to the main Crakehalls. Strongboar even takes a liking to the Crakehall Freys at Darry.  
Arwood Frey: We don't know much about Arwood, for example we don't know if he was at the Red Wedding. Arwood leads an investigation at Saltpans about who plundered the town. His mother is Bellena Hawick, the Hawick is the noble family from Saltpans. Arwood has four children with Ryella Royce Ryella, Alyn, Androw and Hostella Frey.  
Lucias Vypren: Lucias tracks a group of outlaws after the hanging of Merrett Frey. They might have something to do with it. Lucias is married to Lythene Frey, they got two children. Damon Vypren and Elyana Vypren who is married to Jon Wylde and they got one kid, Rickard Wylde.  
~~Symond Frey~~: Symond is the spymaster at the Twins. He is not really shown to be a terrible person but he uses his wives handmaidens as spies in White Harbor and he tries to bribe multiple guards and servants. He leaves for Winterfell but is never seen again (Frey pie). He is married to Betharios of Braavos, they got three children. Alesander, Alyx and Bradamar.  
Alesander, Alyx and Bradamar Frey: Alyx is described as one of the more beautiful maidens presented to Robb. Alesander is one of the Frey who was not allowed to be at the Red Wedding. This worries Caitlyn helped her understand something was wrong.  
Danwell Frey: He is married to Wynafrei Whent. They can't seem to get any children but they got a lot of miscarriages and stillbirths (Whents being cursed?) Danwell is also a bit of a disappointment to his dad. He fails and riding and isn't as strong as the other Crakehall Freys, the only time he doesn't fuck up is during the Red Wedding where he was supposed to make Marq Piper drunk and capture him. In which Danwell succeeds. He currently lives with the Crakehall Freys at Darry.  
~~Merrett Frey~~: Merret Frey is the best known Frey because he was a POV character. He cares for his siblings and their offspring. He dislikes/hates the Alfa Freys and even though he talked often about personal stuff he mistrusts Lame Lothar. He thinks that he needs to earn his family a place at the Twins or find another place. Merrett and his family try this in different ways: They all start living at Darry because Merrett's wife is Mariya Darry so they claim it, Hosteen tries secure the North and get the Dreadfort through ""Fat"" Walda's offspring and Merrett tries to gain favour with the Alfa Freys by paying for Petyr Pimple's life. He get hanged by Lady Stoneheart on flimsy evidence. Jaime describes him as stupid and a bully but strong.  
""Gatehouse"" Ami Frey: The slut of the family. She slept with everybody and now through her mother she rules the Darry lands. Ami also has lots of other Freys around her, especially many Crakehall Freys. Strongboar tries to win favour with her by promising her the killers of her father. Her mother Mariya Darry and her sister Marissa Frey are also with her.  
""Fat"" Walda Frey: Another daughter of Merrett, she is currently the Lady of the North and pregnant. Not certain how long that will last.  
~~""Little"" Walder Frey~~:  Like father like son. He bullies Big Walder, the Reeds, Bran Stark and later participates in torturing Theon/Reek. In the end the little shit is murdered by someone unknown but suspects include: Ramsay, Manderly and Lady Dustin.  
~~Geremy Frey~~: Drowned while drunk driving.  
Carolei Waynwood, Sandor Frey and Cynthea Frey are at the Waynwoods in the Vale.  
Raymund Frey: The last Crakehall Frey is Raymund. Almost nothing is known about him and his offspring. He is only seen twice. Once at the beginning of the Red Wedding and a second time when he slits Caitlyn's throat.   
Raymund is married to Beony Beesbury and they got seven children including two twinpairs. Robert, Malwyn, Serra, Sarra, Cersei, Tywin and Jaime Frey. Judging by the cute nicknames their children get they are well liked.  
The Crakehall Freys don't have the best relation with the other Freys and they generally seem stupid, slow and like boars/hogs/pigs.

&amp;#x200B;

Faction 9: The Blackwood Freys - the schemers  
The Blackwood Freys are descendants of Walder Frey and Alyssa Blackwood.  
""Lame"" Lothar Frey: The steward of the Freys. Lothar was apparently the one that planned most of the Red Wedding. Including the signal Rains of Castamere. Lothar is dangerous according to Merrett Frey. Merrett talked often with Lothar, Lothar said that the Alfa Freys hated each other and all the other Freys. He was convinced that the Alfa Freys would throw anybody out of the Twins unless they were useful. This is the reason so many Freys agreed to help at the Red Wedding or keep their mouths shut. They would otherwise lose their home. Lothar is probably scheming to make himself lord of the Twins.  
Leonalla Lefford: Lothars wife and they got four daughters called Tysane, Walda, Emberlei and Leana.  
Jammos Frey: Lothars brother married to Sallei Paege and they got three sons ""Big"" Walder, Dickon and Mathis. Big Walder is convinced that he will be Lord of the Crossing. If Lothar usurps the Twins Jammos would be his heir and after that Big Walder. So he might not be entirely wrong.  
Whalen Frey: Lothars other brother married to Sylwa Paege. He drinks himself to sleep trying to make the Greatjon drunk. He has a son and a daughter Hoster and Merianne. Hoster is a squire at the Paege lands.  
Moyra Frey: Moyra is married to Flement Brax. They got three sons Robert, Walder and Jon Brax. Flement Brax is one of the more important commanders at the Lannister camp. He also rides with Jaime to finish the Siege of Riverrun.  
Tyta ""the maid"" Frey: She is apparently a 30 year old maiden.  
Both Lothar Frey and Big Walder seems very smart and scheming. The Blackwood Freys are also tied into the Paeges who were noted to be absent during the siege of Riverrun.  


Faction 9: The Rosby Freys - the loved Freys  
The Rosby Freys are descendants of Walder Frey and Bethany Rosby.  
Perwyn Frey: Part of Robbs personal bodyguard. Excluded from the Red Wedding. Described by Daven as a decent man.  
~~Benfrey Frey~~: Married to Jyanna Frey. They have two children called ""Deaf"" Della and Osmund. Benfrey gave away Roslin during the Red Wedding. His face got smashed by Dacey Mormont with glass when he tried to grab her arm. He later died of infection.  
Maester Willamen: A maester at Longbow Hall of house Hunter, a mayor house in the Vale.  
Olyvar Frey: Robbs loyal squire that didn't want to leave him even after he betrayed their house.  
Roslin Frey: The girl that married Edmure. She seems to love him very much and fears for his life. Both Edmure and Roslin seem to be some of the sweetest characters.  
Because of their Rosby ancestry the Rosby Freys are also more beautiful than the others.

&amp;#x200B;

Faction 10: the Farring Freys - the bastards  
Arwyn, Wendel, Colmar, Waltyr, Elmar, Shirei are all still children and are suspected of that they are not Walders brood but Black Walders children.  


Remaining:  
Bastard Walder Rivers: A great fighter and good commander. He leads the Freys often into battle. Described as a cunt with a black heart. Has a son, a daughter and a granddaughter. Walda, Aemon and Walda.  
Maester Melwys: A maester at castle Rosby, a rich house in the crownlands.  
Jeyne Rivers and Mellara Rivers: No noted importance  
Martyn Rivers: One of the best scouts after the Blackfish. He seems to have been friends with Perwyn Frey.  
Ryger Rivers: A courteous guy towards Caitlyn.  
Ronel Rivers: Captured at Harrenhall and later ransomed.

Ser Theo Frey: The Frey that came out of nowhere and was suddenly cool enough to go to tourneys with the main Freys.

5. **What to take away from this?**  


Whew, that was long. I knew the Frey family was big but this is just absurd. People think the Freys will die out. I don't think you can kill them anymore, they breed as fast as rabbits. But back to the point, this should be a learning experience.  
I wrote this for myself more than anything but maybe there are some other crazy people like me out there that care for big families. I wonder if anybody took the time to read through to the end.

What to take away from this? This is a help tool when you read the Winds of Winter. You can easily look up this post and  check what Freys you want dead and what Freys are kinda bros. So you won't be cheering when Lady Stoneheart kills innocents, children, guys who weren't there and people who were working towards making the world a better place.  
Use this post so you won't be surprised when Lothar usurps the Twins or Bastard Walder wins an epic battle or Edwyn and Black Walder kill each other. 

This post is also my research before I try to predict what will happen within the Riverlands during Winds of Winter. I haven't figured everything out: Will Jaime and Brienne escape, will the Brotherhood keep supporting Lady Stoneheart, will she take revenge during Davens wedding, where is the Blackfish, will the Crannogmen do anything, what happened to the Tully garrison, will the Vale invade and what sides will the Freys fight on. Basically I have not yet figured anything out.

I also wanted to highlight the fact that plenty of Freys do good things. Arwood and the Haigh go to help Saltpans when they get raided, Lucias Vypren searches for outlaws, Martyn and Ryger are really courteous, Hosteen seems to love his brother and his kids, Alesander, Perwyn and Olyvar who supported Robb so much they weren't allowed at the wedding, Roslin who prays for a girl so Edmure won't be killed, shoutout again to Edmure for being one of the few lords who protects his smallfolk, Ami who lets her disgraced family stay with her before they are probably kicked out of the Twins, Merrett who goes to rescue his brother from another mother, Danwell who is a fuckup but stays loyal through the bullying, Raymund who seems to have a loving wife and family, Septon Luceon who is really popular and almost got voted High Septon, Fair Walda, White Walda, Little bee and other wholesome names, Genna and her children who all seem great guys, Cleos who was maybe a bit dumb but not a bad guy, Walton who by all accounts doesn't seem like a bad dude and Petyr who through all the bullying kept with his family. The Frey rule over the Riverlands also doesn't look all that bad, they don't harass the populace.  
Maybe they aren't the best and maybe the bad things are more plentiful. The Freys also have hearts.

&amp;#x200B;

The final point is: George RR Martin always write grey characters. The Lannisters seem all bad but when you get into their heads and explore their side only Cersei and Tywin seem worse. The Freys are the same, why would GRRM write a family with 200 members and then make them all ugly weasels that like to kill people. With 200 members you will get some terrible apples and some sweet ones. Right now I would argue that a lot of the bad apples have died already.

Despite this a lot of the fandom seems to assume that the various heroic figures (particularly the Last Hero of First Man myth and Azor Ahai of Rhlorric faith) are the same person. Whilst I firmly support the idea that Azor Ahai, Huggo Amai of Sarnath, Hukko of Pentos, Hugor of the Hill, and Hyrkoon the Hero are the same myth in different forms I don't think that all heroes said to have ended the Long Night are the same. The Rhoynar claim a giant turtle ended the Night and the Yi-Ti that the Lion of Night and Maiden of Light did it. The reason the various Azor variants work is because they are clearly etymologically and thematically linked, with a focus the sacrifice of women, blood magic and a sacred sword. By contrast the Last Hero myth is about a man seeking the children of the forest, losing his dog, horse and companions then at last riding out to fight for the Dawn founding the Night Watch, and The Prince That was Promised seems to have even less to do with Azor Ahai, simply saying that a saviour would come from the Blood of the Dragon. Do people feel that these legends are the same legend or are they simply several different cultures rationalising the end of the Long Night - to use a real world example Noah's Ark and the Greek Myth of Deucalion are both flood myths probably talking about the same flood but no one says that Deucalion IS Noah.

Writing Part 3 took me down a bajillion side wormhole posts I wanted to have finished before I posted Part 3. Then I decided to just finish *everything* I wanted to write before posting again.

And now it's about to be 2019 and very, very soon I will *finally* be posting Part 3. In the intervening time, the readership of the sub has obviously experienced a ton of turnover, and many people active prolly don't know anything about these theories, so I thought I would share the links to them, since it's vital to understand the thesis of Part 2, especially, if Part 3 is going to make any sense.

**TL;DR of [PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6206je/spoilers_extended_littlefingers_third_knight/):** Contrary to a somewhat popular belief, Arya's Dead Man By The Pool in the House of Black &amp; White is not the long-lost Tyrek Lannister (one of Robert's two squires who was forced into a marriage to an infant, dubbed ""Wet Nurse"" by the other squires, and who disappeared during the riot in King's Landing in ACOK), as many think, but one Alesander Frey.

Like: it's makes a *ton* of sense, thematically, phenotypically, etc. And yet I conclude by stating:
&gt;Having come this far, and (I hope) presented the powerful case that Ser Byron is Tyrek Lannister, I have a confession: I don't think he is. But I do think we'll be openly led to believe he is, and that we must be convinced that it truly seems like Byron is Tyrek—a Loras-bodied, Joffrey-looking Sansa-mirror, the perfect true knight to enchant ""Alayne"" into going rogue and fleeing the vale—to understand what's really going on.

Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I thought it was pretty cut and dry that Tyrion was coerced by Tywin to participate in Tysha's rape, in turn becoming a rape survivor himself. However, I heard recently people stating clearly that Tyrion was a willing participant, primarily based off his retelling to Shae in *A Clash of Kings, Tyrion X ""* …and I should have defied him, but my cock betrayed me, and I did as I was bid.""

&amp;#x200B;

Their reasoning being:

1. There's no indication he couldn't have just walked away from the situation
2. Having an erection means he was aroused by the gang rape and therefore willing
3. Tywin and Tyrion are alike, so if Tywin was okay with it Tyrion must have been as well.

Are you really telling me that a disabled thirteen year old being commanded by the third most powerful man in the kingdom, who happens to be his father, had the wherewithal and ability to say no and walk away?

&amp;#x200B;

Are you actually stating that a 13 year old getting an erection indicates that he's willing to participate in a gang rape, even though it's described as a betrayal i.e. going against what the child actually wants to do?

&amp;#x200B;

How do you even go about explaining your last point with a straight face?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to name and shame, but really, am I in the minority here?Just in case, here's a bit more information on what can define rape ""The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent.""  


EDIT: On looking back at the conversation the third point their intent might have been more like ""Tyrion became more like Tywin due to what happened which is exactly what Tywin wanted"" but it's a little clunky. Here's a transcript:  


1 “…In Tyrion’s later recollection, it wasn’t him being forced to participate in Tysha’s rape, it was that his cock betrayed him. Now, I guess it’s important to note in that kind of second telling that Tyrion is indicating that he has a choice in the matter. How much of it was actually a choice and how much of it is his guilt causing him to think that it’s a choice when it really wasn’t is… I don’t know, I guess it’s at least mentioning as a potential consideration, but you really can’t excuse Tyrion’s role necessarily. He was a willing participant in Tysha’s rape. There’s no indication from Tyrion’s point of view in this chapter or when he tells Shae in *A Clash of Kings* that he couldn’t have just walked away and said ‘No, I won’t take part in this’. He basically said that he had sexual desire for Tysha and that he participated in her rape.”  
2 “One of the takeaways from this is that what Tywin was trying to do to Tyrion worked at some level, because Tyrion does think about Tysha this way – “   
1 “Yeah”   
2 “– and kinda clearly did in the moment if he was still willing to have sex with her even after watching this horror inflicted upon her. Like, the mental transition had been made. Tyrion thinks of her that way and has dehumanised her that way, just as Tywin wanted, and Tywin is Tyrion’s abuser but Tyrion has become Tywin in a lot of ways - ”   
1 “Yes”   
2 “- in terms of his mindset, in terms of his actions. And so you have a position where Tyrion is certainly a victim of Tywin but also complicit in the abuse of Tysha, and so that’s where he gets his aunt Genna saying that Tyrion is Tywin’s son, not you, to Jaime. And Tyrion saying the latter’s final moments that I’m you writ small.“   
1 “Mmm hmm”   
2 “That’s what makes this kinda thing I think as powerful as it is on a tragic element, that is as much as Tyrion and Tywin would like to distance themselves from each other, they are at some level the same person.”  
1 “It makes it even worse when you think about Tyrion’s arc in *A Dance with Dragons* and how dark it gets, in that the reveal that Tysha was not a sex worker, the reveal that it wasn’t that Jaime had paid for her services, that leads to Tyrion becoming ever more like Tywin Lannister, whether it’s raping a sex worker in Selhorys, whether it’s thinking ‘If I was in charge of the battle at The Battle of Fire I would have poisoned all the wells’, it’s just so brutal that the reveal that Tysha’s backstory was exactly what Tyrion had originally suspected to be, but then gone on believing that for some thirteen or fourteen years believing the story that Jaime and Tywin had told him, that that then leads to Tyrion becoming so much more Tywin just makes it ever more hearbreaking, what happens to him in *A Dance with Dragons*, and what will continue in *The Winds of Winter*.” ",1,(Spoilers Main) Tyrion's complicity with Tysha,4780,46

[Here](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/asoiaf/new-pov-i-spoilers-for-affc-t734.html) is the report for the draft of Cersei II read in Sep 2001 Worldcon. One thing not mentioned in the report is the mysterious Gardener coins Qyburn discovered in the cell of Rugen (which as we know was one of the disguises of Varys). If it was mentioned in the early draft, surely the people who took such detailed notes would have noted it and discussed what it might mean. In the published story, Gardener coins serve as just another tool that furthers Cersei’s paranoia about the Tyrells. It is obvious that Varys planted them in order to sabotage the Lannister/Tyrell alliance. 

* The discarding of the 5 year gap resulted in dramatic changes to the original plans. At the beginning, Cersei was meant to rule for 5 years. Once the gap was gone, the Lannister/Tyrell alliance had to fail much sooner than anticipated. GRRM invented several tools to make this process work faster in his mind. One of them was the introduction of Maggy’s prophecy to greatly fast-forward Cersei’s descent into madness. As this early draft implies, another later addition for breaking up the Lannister/Tyrell alliance effectively seems like the decision to leave Varys behind so that he could actively sabotage it.

* The interesting question is this: if Varys was not supposed to plant these coins in the early draft, what was he supposed to do and where was he supposed to be? I argued in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9ygd21/spoilers_extended_quaithe_and_the_meereenese_knot/) that Varys was originally going to Meereen in the 5-year-gap scenario and he was the perfumed seneschal Quaithe warned Dany about. Since the 5-year-gap was discarded and Varys stayed behind, GRRM had to create another perfumed seneschal coming to Meereen (or else he would have dropped it from Quaithe’s warning). And I think the new perfumed seneschal is Marwyn. Either he or Quaithe is bad news for Dany. Probably both.

0,1,0,40,121,"Earlier I posted a [well-received theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/7yy61a/spoilers_extended_unnoticed_point_about_the_pink/) that magic in ASOIAF has a few simple rules rooted in sacrifice to certain elemental forces:  In short: You are what eats you.  If you give your blood or a kinsman's blood to an element, your blood is somewhat amended by it and you become resistant to its effects.  Craster sacrifices his sons to the cold; the Others pass him by.  Gared has lost his ears to frostbite and a brother to hypothermia; the Others let him flee.  The Ironborn sacrifice to the sea and are unstoppable there.  Melisandre, who sacrifices to fire, is able to walk unburned in the hottest places in Dragonstone.  I think of this as the Pantheon (""all the gods"") theory.

The seats of the great houses include features that would facilitate sacrifice to an element that is characteristic of that house.  The Arryns have a Moon Door, and their dungeon is the Sky Cells, where prisoners are encouraged to leap to their deaths.  The Tullys have the water stair – direct river access within the castle walls.  The Starks have an iron cage where prisoners can be exposed to the cold.  And Casterly Rock has oubliettes as tight, Jaime says, as a suit of armor, where the Lannisters of old sacrificed high nobles and even kings.

A few other examples have come to mind.  First, a cunningly hidden example of an in-world character who seems to know the rules of magic:

# Randyll Tarly

When Sam fails to be the heir his father wanted despite a courage spell, Randyll makes Sam choose between taking the black and being murdered.  But it's *how* he would be murdered that's interesting:

&gt;“If you do not, then **on the morrow we shall have a hunt, and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble, and you will be thrown from the saddle to die** . . . or so I will tell your mother. She has a woman's heart and finds it in her to cherish even you, and I have no wish to cause her pain. Please do not imagine that it will truly be that easy, should you think to defy me. **Nothing would please me more than to hunt you down like the pig you are**.” His arms were red to the elbow as he laid the skinning knife aside. “So.  There is your choice.  The Night's Watch”—he reached inside the deer, ripped out its heart, and held it in his fist, red and dripping—“or this.”

This shows GRRM's genius:  A hunting accident is a timeworn way to disguise a murder.  And we are primed to interpret Randyll's threat that way because it is how Cersei kills Robert.  But the cliche hides a second meaning:  The Tarlys’ god is *the hunt*, like their sigil, and Randyll is proposing to sacrifice his heir by hunting him.  (The Greeks and Romans had goddesses of the hunt, Artemis and Diana.)

# Belwas

Belwas proclaims himself greater than Khrazz, supposedly the greatest champion in the history of the fighting pits.  How has Belwas survived so long?  He sacrifices himself a bit in each combat.  He says so twice.  First when he is introduced:

&gt;“I am Belwas. Strong Belwas they name me in the fighting pits of Meereen. Never did I lose.” He slapped his belly, covered with scars. “**I let each man cut me once, before I kill him.** Count the cuts and you will know how many Strong Belwas has slain.”

And again after the fight before the walls of Meereen:

&gt;“It is nothing. I let each man cut me once, before I kill him.” He slapped his bloody belly.

Who is Belwas sacrificing himself to?  His opponents, or to combat generally?  It’s not clear.  But his custom is too strange, amid the other evidence of blood sacrifice, to be coincidence.

# The Unsullied

It is fitting that Daenerys acquires an army of Unsullied, because the Unsullied too have sacrificed to fire – and not a small sacrifice:

&gt;""The goddess is called by many names. She is the Lady of Spears, the Bride of Battle, the Mother of Hosts, but **her true name belongs only to these poor ones who have burned their manhoods upon her altar**.""

The Unsullied wash with sand, not water and, consistent with the idea that sacrifice to an element confers some immunity to it, the Unsullied bear up well even in the heat of Meereen.

# The Night’s Watch

In the earlier post I raised the idea that the Night’s Watch is the Seven Kingdoms' sacrifice to the cold, and the Wall is the instrument for that sacrifice.  If the wards alone would keep the Others out, why bother with the ice?  To ensure that it is “always cold at the Wall”.  Consistent with that idea, the dungeon at Castle Black is the ice cells.  And if sacrificing onesself to an element amends the blood with it, the men of the Night's Watch *do* become brothers in a sense as they stay longer at the Wall and give more of themselves to the cold.

The notion that the Wall is an instrument of cold sacrifice is supported by Fire and Blood:

&gt;The men of the Night’s Watch were as thunderstruck by the queen’s dragon as the people of White Harbor had been, though the queen herself noted that Silverwing “does not like this Wall.” Though it was summer and the Wall was weeping, *the chill of the ice could still be felt whenever the wind blew, and* ***every gust would make the dragon hiss and snap***. “Thrice I flew Silverwing high above Castle Black, and thrice I tried to take her north beyond the Wall,” Alysanne wrote to Jaehaerys, “but every time she veered back south again and refused to go. Never before has she refused to take me where I wished to go.”

As [others](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9r9mi3/spoilers_extended_what_is_the_reason_for_this_old/) have pointed out, between ASOS and ADWD Bran seems to amend his memory of Old Nan's reassurances that the Others cannot pass south ""so long as the Wall stands *and the men of the Night's Watch stay true*\[.\]""  As I argued in Part I, joining the Night's Watch is a way of sacrificing your whole remaining life to the cold.  But only if you keep the vows!  And Jacquen tells us early that there are consequences for stealing sacrifices from the gods:

&gt;""The Red God has his due, sweet girl, and only death may pay for life. This girl took three that were his. This girl must give three in their places. Speak the names, and a man will do the rest.""

Except as a reason to help Arya escape Harrenhal, this notion of sacrifice owed to a god is a shoe that has yet to drop.  I think it will come to the fore at least two ways.  First, if the Seven Kingdoms owe a sacrifice to the cold, Jon Snow has committed grave breaches.  Not only has he foresworn his vow and announced his intent to leave the Wall – withdrawing the sacrifice of his own life – but he has helped steal Monster from the Others.  If the Wildlings themselves were part of the Pact – either as hostages for humanity, or as a free-range sacrifice north of the Wall – letting them pass south might have been a further breach.

Regardless, Jon deserved his death because he broke his vow to be part of Westeros’s sacrifice to the cold.  That view of the Night's Watch oath fits Bran's vision:

&gt;He saw the Wall shining like blue crystal, and his bastard brother Jon **sleeping alone in a cold bed, his skin growing pale and hard as the memory of all warmth fled from him.**

At least since ADWD, the conventional view has been that this passage is Bran’s premonition of a dead Jon.  But it could be a glimpse of Jon's purpose as a man of the Watch:  Jon is cold because it is always cold at the Wall.  He is sleeping alone because he has sworn to take no wives and father no children.  And the memory of all warmth is fleeing from him because the cold is gradually claiming his life.  In fact, the cold got that life in the end:

&gt;He never felt the fourth knife. ***Only the cold*** ...

In this light, look again at the Horn of Joramun.  If the Wall is an altar to the cold gods, the Horn is not just a doomsday weapon, but a horn to blow in triumph when that sacrifice can be renounced.

# Dorne

Many readers (myself included) were annoyed to see so many Dornish characters introduced so late.  But remember that we will need the Dornish god, the sun:

&gt;The salty Dornishmen were lithe and dark, with smooth olive skin and long black hair streaming in the wind. The sandy Dornishmen were even darker, **their faces burned brown by the hot Dornish sun**. They wound long bright scarfs around their helms to ward off sunstroke. The stony Dornishmen were biggest and fairest, sons of the Andals and the First Men, brown-haired or blond, with **faces that freckled or burned in the sun instead of browning**.

Sun imagery surrounds Prince Oberyn, whose battle dress shows he views the sun as an ally.  Tyrion notes that Oberyn has removed the visor from his helm.  No need to shield his eyes (at least from the sun, heh.)  And Oberyn is on defense throughout his battle with Ser Gregor – until the sun comes out:

&gt;The Mountain snorted contemptuously, and came on . . . and **in that moment, the sun broke through the low clouds** that had hidden the sky since dawn.  
&gt;  
&gt;***The sun of Dorne***, Tyrion told himself, but it was Gregor Clegane who moved first to put the sun at his back.  
&gt;  
&gt;*This is a dim and brutal man, but he has a warrior’s instincts.* The Red Viper crouched, squinting, and sent his spear darting forward again. Ser Gregor hacked at it, but the thrust had only been a feint. Off balance, he stumbled forward a step.  
&gt;  
&gt;Prince Oberyn tilted his dinted metal shield. **A shaft of sunlight blazed blindingly off polished gold and copper, into the narrow slit of his foe’s helm. Clegane lifted his own shield against the glare.** Prince Oberyn’s spear flashed like lightning and found the gap in the heavy plate, the joint under the arm.

Of course, the “sun of Dorne” is the sun everywhere.  But if the Dornish are allied with the sun as the Targaryens are allied with fire and the Ironborn are allied with the sea, the new Dornish characters look like a necessary part of the alliance against the two hazards of the Long Night: the cold *and the dark*.  That future alliance might have been why Aegon I spared the Dornish in the first place.

# The Ironborn

I don’t have any particularized ideas for the Ironborn, except that their sudden prominence in AFFC might be explained by their alliance with the sea, just as the Dornish are explained by their alliance with the sun.  The Ironborn have continued to practice blood sacrifice to the sea.  And one of our POV characters, Aeron, is a priest of that religion.

# Further implications and possibilities

*Bloodraven*.  Giving yourself gradually to an element to become one with it is precisely what the COTF claim Bloodraven has done and what he urges Bran to do:  The tree roots have grown into him and absorbed his flesh and blood, and Bloodraven has become part of the tree.

*Reek.*  I noted in Part I that flaying is a way of sacrificing to the air.  House Bolton's most ardent flayer is known for keeping company with (and being unaffected by) Reek I and II, known for the bad air that accompanies them.  Ramsay even hid his identity by smearing himself with excrement and adopting the reeky mantle for himself.  The symmetry seems significant.

*Aerea*.  In Fire &amp; Blood, we read the fate of young Aerea, who &gt;!leapt onto Balerion’s back and flew with him, Septon Barth suspects, to Valyria.  When she returned, her body was scalding to the touch, and firewyrms writhed within her skin.  Both girl and wyrms died when they were doused in icewater!&lt;.

I think Aerea is another example of the principle that in ASOIAF you are what eats you.  &gt;!If a firewyrm is full of dragonfire even when it is very small, contracting firewyrms would be a way to sacrifice oneself to dragonfire slowly enough to become quite dragonlike by the times the wyrms matured!&lt;.

*Harrenhal.*  Seemingly all the seats of the great houses include some feature that would facilitate sacrifice to a particular element.  Although Harrenhal was built long after those castles, I think it's no exception:  Harren was going to sacrifice to the Gods Eye, a sacred lake:

&gt;Its colossal curtain walls rose beside the lake, sheer and sudden as mountain cliffs\[.\]

We know the Isle of Faces in the Gods Eye is central to the Pact.  By proposing to become king of the Gods Eye, Harren might have crossed a red line in the bargain struck to end the Long Night.

*Our willing sacrifices*.  Using the logic that sacrifice to an element wins its allegiance for you and your kin, House Martell might be in an unusually good position vis a vis dragons or the Targaryens/Blackfyres.  Although Quentyn the Dragontamer was tragically unwilling to burn himself with the candle before he left to tame dragons, he arguably sacrificed himself to dragonfire when he arrived.

Did he die by dragonfire?  I think so.  But one could argue that Quentyn might have joined the characters who seem immune to elemental forces they willingly confront.  For example:

* Tyrion survives drowning after he tackles the stone man, though without a nose he couldn't hope to keep out the waters of the Rhoyne.
* Theon survives a long jump off the walls of Winterfell.
* Daenerys herself survives a walk into Drogo’s funeral pyre.

We see Quentyn notice his clothes are on fire, then start screaming.  He doesn't perceive any pain, but pain can lag injury in the real world.  Then again, Daenerys’s clothes burned in the pyre even when she didn't, and she didn’t perceive any pain either.  Assuming that this kind of all-in self-sacrifice is survivable, the difficulty might be that Quentyn was not burned by the dragon he chose to tame; he was burned by the one he forgot about.

In any event, perhaps a new footnote in the “Quentyn Lives” debate.  And even if Quentyn died, his death might have positioned the remaining Martells to enjoy a special affinity from Dany’s dragons, Dany herself, or fAegon.

**tl;dr:  There are suggestions of a coherent theory of magic in ASOIAF based on winning the allegiance of certain elemental forces through blood sacrifice. That theory may be a useful lens for predicting future developments.**",1,(Spoilers Extended) Pantheon Theory Part II: More evidence for the Pantheon,14177,75

#Sansa and Sandor's REAL (But Still Figurative) Wedding

A few years back, /u/cantuse [crafted a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1uv7gr/spoilers_all_sansa_the_pretty_little_maegi/) arguing persuasively that when Sansa tries to hide her bloody menstruel sheets by burning them in her fireplace in ACOK, she in effect uses fire-and-blood-fueled bloodmagic—definitely figuratively, maybe even literally—to summon herself a hero to save her from her marriage to Joffrey, and is ""given"" Sandor, *whom she symbolically marries, thus passing into his protection, when she imagines kissing him and when she huddles under the stained Kingsguard cloak he leaves in her room:*
&gt;**She found his cloak on the floor, twisted up tight**, the white wool stained by blood and fire.… A chill wind was blowing, banging the shutters. Sansa was cold. **She shook out the torn cloak and huddled beneath it on the floor, shivering.** (COK San VII)

More recently, /u/7th_Cuil revived this theory as part of [a larger post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/5vtu75/spoilers_main_sandor_clegane_the_antiknight_and/) on Sandor.

It's my belief that there is actually strong evidence that Sansa doesn't ""really"" figuratively marry Sandor when she first ""huddled beneath"" his cloak, but that instead she transforms Sandor's abandoned Kingsguard cloak into a facsimile of Sandor's *personal* cloak, which she later dons as a figurative bride's cloak during a different figurative marriage ceremony than the one posited by cantuse and 7th: *a proper northern wedding in a godswood, before a heart tree.*

(Note that this has nothing to do with whether Sansa and Sandor will end up ""in love"" or *literally* married or anything of the sort. It's straight textual analysis or some pretty blatant symbolism.)

***

##White Ain't Sandor's Color
First thing's first: A knight of the Kingsguard can't marry, so a white Kingsguard cloak being a symbolic wedding cloak feels a bit off.

Moreover, Sandor doesn't just forget his Kingsguard cloak. Nor does he give it to Sansa. Instead he discards it, abandoning it as he does the Kingsguard. The white cloak Sansa shivers in isn't *truly* Sandor's cloak anymore, literally or figuratively, nor does it represent Sandor as an individual. At least not *literarily*, to us. *Not while it remains a white Kingsguard cloak, anyway*. (That said, it certainly may represent Sandor to Sansa, and thus the scene works as an expression of her subconscious, inchoate desire for him.)

There is, of course, a mundane sense in which the cloak is nevertheless still ""Sandor's"". Certainly the text refers to it accordingly as ""his cloak"", so the *idea* of Sansa wearing ""Sandor's"" cloak as in a Westerosi wedding is certainly immanent here, even if it's only being gestured at. But it's my belief that this idea isn't anchored in strong symbolism until the aftermath of the Purple Wedding, when Sansa and Sandor get figuratively married for real (so to speak).

##The Hound's Green Cloaks (and plain brown roughspun clothes)

While a White Cloak hardly embodies Sandor, he does show a strong personal preference when it comes to his fabric choices. Here's Sandor early in AGOT at Ned's Tourney—that is, at an event in which men expressly dress themselves in their personalized, identifiable colors:
&gt;Sandor Clegane was the first rider to appear. He wore **an olive-green cloak** over his soot-grey armor. (GOT E VII)

He wears a green cloak (over soot-grey armor).

Here's Sandor late in AGOT:
&gt;""You will attend me in court this afternoon,"" Joffrey said. ""See that you bathe and dress as befits my betrothed."" Sandor Clegane stood at his shoulder in **a plain brown doublet and *green mantle*,** his burned face hideous in the morning light. Behind them were **two knights of the Kingsguard in long white satin cloaks.** (GOT S VI)

Again, a green cloak (i.e. ""mantle""—see below), this time implicitly contrasted with the Kingsguards' white cloaks, thus showcasing Sandor's chosen cloak color.

Make no mistake: a ""mantle"" is a cloak.
&gt;A mantle (from mantellum, the Latin term for **a cloak**) is a type of loose garment usually worn over indoor clothing to serve the same purpose as an overcoat. Technically, the term describes **a long, loose cape-like cloak** worn from the 12th to the 16th century by both sexes, although by the 19th century, it was used to describe any loose-fitting, shaped outer garment similar to a cape. (wikipedia)

Notice, too, that Sandor's clothing here is otherwise *""a plain brown doublet""*. Even after he's a Kingsguard, Sandor wears *""his brown roughspun tunic""* under his white cloak. (COK S I) I know it's only cloaks that are changed at a literal wedding, but as you'll see in a minute, some people don't stop there when the wedding is symbolic.

To clarify: I'm not arguing that in-world Sandor necessarily wears these/this green cloak(s) to declare his identity that same way a Lannister might so wear a red and gold cloak. I'm only saying that as a practical matter of fact, *Sandor's personal cloaks are green* (and that he seems to favor simple brown wool garments under the cloak, when he's not wearing his ""soot-grey armor""). He *may* view green cloaks as his own hallmark, but whether he does or not isn't important to the present hypothesis, which is about a *symbolic/figurative* wedding (cloak).

Much later, when Sandor is traveling to Riverrun with Arya, he is in disguise, and what do we see? His coloration symbolically reflects that he is in hiding, *reversing itself* like Oberyn's daughter Sarella disguising herself as ""Alleras"" the Sphinx in AFFC. Now his body, which was garbed in soot-grey armor at the tourney, is garbed in green like his old cloak and mantle, while his green cloak and mantle are replaced by a cloak the color of his soot-grey tourney armor:
&gt;…the Hound himself was garbed in **splotchy green roughspun and a soot-grey mantle with a hood that swallowed his head.** (SOS A X)

Notice that he still favors simple roughspun. Note, too, that Sandor's disguise ""mantle"" has a *huge* hood. Did the cloaks he wore earlier have hoods as well?

One might ask, ""What happened to the green cloak/mantle he wore before?"" It will be my argument that it was figuratively passed to Sansa, who dons ""it"" in a symbolic wedding ceremony in the Red Keep's godswood. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Finally, as Sandor is ""dying"", a green cloak manages to find him again:
&gt;When the time came to leave, [Sandor] needed Arya's help to get back up on Stranger. He had tied a strip of cloth about his neck and another around his thigh, and taken the squire's cloak off its peg by the door. **The cloak was green**, with a green arrow on a white bend, but when **the Hound wadded it up** and pressed it to his ear it soon turned red. (SOS A XIII)

The Hound wadding up this green cloak and getting it bloody naturally recalls the unintentional ""bloodmagic"" ritual by which Sansa at least figuratively ""summoned"" Sandor:
&gt;Snatching up her knife, Sansa hacked at the sheet, cutting out the [blood]stain . . . She pulled the torn sheet from the bed, and the stained blanket as well. I'll have to burn them. **She balled up the evidence**, stuffed it in the fireplace, drenched it in oil from her bedside lamp, and lit it afire. (COK S IV)

##Weddings and the Boles of (Ancient) Oak Heart Trees
Sandor is also associated with the color green when he ""is"" a green leaf during Arya's ""prayers"" in the Harrenhal godswood:
&gt;The queen and Ser Ilyn and Ser Meryn and **the Hound were only leaves**, but [Arya] killed them all as well, slashing them to wet **green** ribbons. (COK A IX)

Arya's ""prayers"" ultimately focus on Joffrey—Sansa's betrothed at the time—and ""the bole of an oak"":
&gt;**[Arya] slashed at birch leaves** till the splintery point of the broken broomstick was **green** and sticky. ""Ser Gregor,"" she breathed. ""Dunsen, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling."" … ""The Tickler,"" she called out one time, **""the Hound,""** the next. ""Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei."" **The bole of an oak loomed before her**, and she lunged to drive her point through it, grunting ""Joffrey, Joffrey, Joffrey."" (A X)

Arya's attack on an oak bole representing Sansa's betrothed is curious in light of several links between oak boles in godswoods, weddings and Sansa.

Consider Sansa first meeting with Dontos in the Red Keep's godswood:
&gt;Ser Dontos placed a hand **on the gnarled bole of the heart tree.** He was shaking, she saw. **""I vow, with your father's gods as witness**, that I shall send you home."" (COK S II)

Dontos is swearing ""on the gnarled bole"" of the Red Keep's ""heart tree"", which we know is also an oak:
&gt;**The [Red Keep's] heart tree there was a great oak, its ancient limbs** overgrown with smokeberry vines… (GOT E V)

By taking an oath (""I vow…"") on the bole of the ""ancient"" heart tree, Dontos reminds us of the northern custom of saying ones *wedding* vows before a heart tree, and thus of weddings in general.

Both trees are described using the term ""bole"". Bole is just a fancy way of saying tree trunk, but *that's the point.* It's *notable* verbiage, and I'm convinced GRRM uses specific verbiage to tag and connect things in his story. While the word ""bole"" doesn't make many other appearances in ASOIAF, most of them point in the direction of ""Northern Weddings"". First, there's a Northern clan named Bole:
&gt;The army covered twenty-two miles the first day, by the reckoning of the guides Lady Sybelle [Glover] had given them, trackers and hunters sworn to Deepwood with clan names like Forrester and Woods, Branch and **Bole**. (DWD tKP)

Second, there's a weirwood described in the same terms (""gnarled and ancient"") used to describe the Red Keep's heart tree:
&gt;From one such island rose **a weirwood gnarled and ancient, its bole** and branches white as the surrounding snows. (DWD tS)

Third and most important, it just so happens that *during ""Arya's"" wedding to Ramsay*, Theon thinks of ""hiding his treasures in *the bole of an ancient oak*"" in Winterfell's Godswood. The idea of hidden treasure makes us think of women's sexuality: Shae is Tyrion's ""secret treasure""; the Watch calls the whores of Moletown ""buried treasure"". Note that Theon's oak and its reference to women's sexuality is described using the same ""ancient"" adjective used to describe the oak heart tree in the Red Keep (and Winterfell's heart tree in AGOT C I). Thus the ancient ""bole-tagged"" oak heart tree on which Dontos says his vow to Sansa at the Red Keep prefigures the ancient ""bole-tagged"", treasure-guarding oak of Winterfell we see when ""Arya"", Sansa's sister, says her wedding vows before Winterfell's ancient heart tree.

Why describe these trees so similarly? Perhaps because the real wedding of the fake Arya echoes the fake/figurative wedding of the real Arya's sister before the Red Keep's Theon's-oak-esque heart tree (or perhaps its textual equivalent, as will be discussed).

##Sansa's ""Marriage"" to Tyrion
Consider what Sansa wears to her actual wedding to Tyrion:
&gt;[T]he **gown** itself was **ivory samite and cloth-of-silver, and lined with silvery satin.** The points of the **long dagged sleeves almost touched the ground** when she lowered her arms. And it was a woman's gown, not a little girl's, there was no doubt of that. The bodice was slashed in front almost to her belly, the deep vee covered over with a panel of ornate Myrish lace in **dove-grey.**… They brought her new shoes as well, **slippers of soft grey doeskin** that hugged her feet like lovers. (SOS San III)

Stark colors, plainly. Meanwhile, her maiden's cloak (i.e. the cloak in the maiden's colors that gets replaced by the bride's cloak, in the groom's colors) is characterized by being ""heavy with pearls"":
&gt;""The cloak,"" [Cersei] commanded, and the women brought it out: a long cloak of white velvet **heavy with pearls.** A fierce direwolf was embroidered upon it in silver thread. Sansa looked at it with sudden dread. ""Your father's colors,"" said Cersei, as they fastened it about her neck with a slender silver chain.

&gt;A maiden's cloak. (ibid.)

Bank that. It's important.

Now, what happens to Sansa after her *actual* wedding to Tyrion, when she's removing her clothing *and thus preparing for the consummation of her wedding?*
&gt;""And my clothing?""

&gt;""That too."" He waved his wine cup at her. ""My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage.""

&gt;**Her hands trembled as she began fumbling at her clothes. She had ten thumbs instead of fingers, and all of them were broken. Yet somehow she managed the laces and buttons,** and her cloak and gown and girdle and undersilk slid to the floor, until finally she was stepping out of her smallclothes.… (SOS San III)

Her hands quake and fumble as she disrobes. Bank that too.

##Sansa's Purple Wedding Garb
The clothing Sansa wears to the Purple Wedding, just before her escape via the godswood with Dontos, sounds curiously similar to what she wore to her wedding to Tyrion:
&gt;Sansa wore a **gown of silvery satin trimmed in vair, with dagged sleeves that almost touched the floor**… (SOS Ty VIII)

That ""gown"" sounds a helluva lot like her wedding ""gown"". It's almost blatantly symbolic of it:

- ""lined with silvery satin"" : ""silvery satin""
- ""long dagged sleeves almost touched the ground"" : ""dagged sleeves that almost touched the floor""
- ""soft grey doeskin"" : ""vair"" (i.e. greyish-blue squirrel fur/skin)

##Sansa's ""Marriage"" To Sandor
Summarizing a few key facts:

- Sandor's favors green mantles/cloaks (worn with ""soot-grey"" armor)

- Sandor pairs his cloak with ""a plain brown doublet"", and later a ""brown roughspun tunic"".
- In disguise, Sandor later wears ""green roughspun"" with a soot-grey mantle, reversing his colors. In a sense, his green mantle is ""missing"", as is his brown roughspun tunic.
- Sandor is given a ""green"" cloak; he ""wadded it up"" and got it bloody, much as Sansa wadded up the sheets stained with her menstrual blood and burned them, a la bloodmagic.
- Arya's ""prayers"" associates the Hound with green.
- They also associate Sansa's bethrothed with the bole of an oak in a godswood.
- Dontos swears a vow on the bole of the Red Keep's ""ancient"" oak heart tree.
- ""Boles"" are associated with the north, and with a weirwood described like the Red Keep's heart tree.
- Theon hides his treasures in the bole of an ""ancient"" oak in Winterfell's godswood.
- Theon remembers this during the wedding of a woman posing as Sansa's sister, which takes placed before Winterfell's (also ""ancient"") heart tree.
- Sansa's fingers fumbled with her clothing after she was married to Tyrion.
- Sansa wears an outfit to the Purple Wedding that reminds us of her wedding outfit.

Now, here's what Sansa does in the Godswood after the Purple Wedding. Remember, at a Westerosi wedding ceremony the bride removes a cloak of her father's colors and dons a cloak of her husband's colors.
&gt;She found her clothes **where she had hidden them**, the night before last. With no maids to help her, **it took her longer than it should have to undo the laces of her gown. Her hands were strangely clumsy**, though she was not as frightened as she ought to have been. ""**The gods** are cruel to take him so young and handsome, at his own wedding feast,"" Lady Tanda had said to her.

&gt;**The gods are just**, thought Sansa. Robb had died at a **wedding feast** as well. It was Robb she wept for. Him and Margaery. Poor Margaery, twice **wed** and twice widowed. Sansa slid her arm from a sleeve, pushed down the gown, and wriggled out of it. **She balled it up and shoved it into the bole of an oak, shook out the clothing she had hidden there.** Dress warmly, Ser Dontos had told her, and dress dark. She had no blacks, so she chose **a dress of thick brown wool. The bodice was decorated with freshwater pearls, though. *The cloak will cover them. The cloak was a deep green, with a large hood*. She slipped the dress over her head, and donned the cloak, though she left the hood down for the moment. There were shoes as well, simple and sturdy, with flat heels and square toes. The gods heard my prayer, she thought. She felt so numb and dreamy. My skin has turned to porcelain, to ivory, to steel. Her hands moved stiffly, awkwardly**, as if they had never let down her hair before. For a moment she wished Shae was there, to help her with **the net**.

&gt;When **she pulled it free**, her long auburn hair cascaded down her back and across her shoulders.… (SOS San V)

Holy motif memories. Where to begin?

Sansa has her clothing hidden just where Theon remembers—*during ""Arya's"" wedding*—hiding his treasures as a youth: in the bole of an oak.

Standing next to the bole of this oak, Sansa's hands get clumsy and stiff, *exactly as they do when she is wed to Tyrion.* Not once, but twice.

Sansa repeatedly thinks of the gods, as you should at your wedding, finally thanking them for hearing her prayer.

She thinks of three different weddings.

Then she takes off her Stark-colored garments—symbolically her maiden marriage clothes and probably literally her wedding shoes, given the remark about the new shoes being ""simple and sturdy"", which would certainly be remarkable if she'd just removed the elegant but impractical ""slippers of soft grey doeskin that hugged her feet like lovers"" she'd worn at her wedding—balls them up (as Sandor balls up the green cloak Arya gives him, and as she balled up her bloody sheets when she ""summoned"" Sandor) and put them in the bole of an oak, textually the very spot in which Theon thinks about hiding things during the only Northern wedding we've witnessed thus far in ASOIAF.

Whether Sansa's oak *is* the Red Keep's heart tree ""in world"" or not is almost irrelevant: the ""bole &amp; oak"" verbiage means there's no mistaking that this shit *symbolically* takes place in front of the godswood's heart tree .

- And what does Sansa put on (besides practical shoes)?

A dress of ""thick brown wool"" that recalls Sandor's preference for brown garments, ""plain"" and ""roughspun"" (i.e. wool).

Just so we don't miss the symbolism here, since Sansa's not wearing a cloak to begin with, there are ""freshwater pearls"" on the dress, just as her maiden's cloak was ""heavy with pearls"". It's foregrounded that these maiden's cloak-esque pearls will shortly be covered by the hood of her cloak, which just so happens to be green *like Sandor's favored green cloak and mantle*.

To be sure, Sansa hasn't literally gotten ahold of Sandor's old green cloak (although that doesn't mean this cloak *isn't* literally Sandor's, either—see below). It's that she is replacing her Stark dress with Sandor's brown roughspun and covering up a symbolic vestige of her pearl-laden maiden's cloak with the huge hood (like the huge hood of Sandor's soot-grey cloak) of her Sandor-green cloak, thereby replacing her symbolic maiden's garb/cloak with a figurative bride's cloak (and dress) in Sandor's *personal* colors.

And again: this all takes place before the ""bole"" of an oak in a godswood whose heart tree is an oak whose ""bole"" has been called out in our story.

Meanwhile, Sansa's ""numb and dreamy"" feel mirrors the pointedly odd sensibility Theon has during the wedding of Sansa's supposed sister at Winterfell (when his mind wanders to the things that can be hidden in the bole of an ancient oak):
&gt;[Theon] had never seen the godswood like this, though—**grey and ghostly, filled with warm mists and floating lights and whispered voices that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere.** (DWD PoW)

Sansa's skin turning figuratively to ""steel""—
&gt;My skin has turned to porcelain, to ivory, to steel.

—sounds like armor, right? This reminds us of what transpires between Tyrion and Sansa *on their wedding night,* just before she disrobes:
&gt;""Courtesy is a lady's armor,"" Sansa said. Her septa had always told her that.

&gt;""I am your husband. You can take off your armor now."" (SOS S III)

Same motif, rejiggered for a new ""wedding""? (Her ""steel"" skin also recalls Sandor pairing his green cloak with his armor.)

When Sansa ""stiffly, awkwardly"" removes her bejeweled hair net, this simultaneously recalls the removal of her bejeweled maiden's cloak at her wedding to Tyrion and her ""fumbling"" disrobing for its consummation.

As she panics about the missing jewel, we get *another* callback to her fumbling on her wedding night:
&gt;She tried to stop, but **her fingers were not her own.** (SOS S V)

Dontos shows up, and his conversation with Sansa—
&gt;**""Who's there?"" she cried. ""Who is it?"" The godswood was dim and dark, and the bells were ringing** Joff into his grave.

&gt;**""Me.""** He staggered out from under the trees, reeling drunk. **He caught her arm** to steady himself. **""Sweet Jonquil, I've come. Your Florian has come, don't be afraid.""** (SOS S V)

—neatly recalls the formula for a northern wedding in a godswood—
&gt;**""Who comes?""** [Ramsay's] lips were moist, his neck red above his collar. **""Who comes before the god?""**

&gt;Theon answered. ""Arya of House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown and flowered, trueborn and noble, she comes to beg the blessings of the gods. **Who comes to claim her?**""

&gt;**""Me,"" said Ramsay. ""Ramsay of House Bolton, Lord of the Hornwood, heir to the Dreadfort.** I claim her."" (DWD PoW)

—even as the godswood is emphasized and ""bells were ringing"", ""wedding bells"" being a ""Thing"" in our world if not in Westeros. (Dontos grabbing Sansa's arm is notable becauase it smells like both a groom ""claim[ing]"" his bride *and* like Theon walking ""arm in arm"" with ""Arya"" to be claimed by Ramsay before Winterfell's heart tree.)

Sansa thinks of how Joff ""had been her gallant prince"", and then we read this tantalizing exchange:
&gt;""Come, we must away, they'll search for you. **Your husband's been arrested.**""

&gt;""Tyrion?"" she said, shocked.

&gt;**""Do you have another husband?** The Imp, the dwarf uncle, she thinks he did it."" (ibid)

Well? *Does* she? She's certainly about to. At least figuratively.

Her symbolic wedding to Sandor is completed, even as she thinks of almost *nothing* but marriage:
&gt;If Tyrion did it, they will think I was part of it as well, she realized with a start of fear. How not? **They were man and wife**, and Joff had killed her father and mocked her with her brother's death. **One flesh, one heart, one soul.**

&gt;""Be quiet now, my sweetling,"" said Dontos. ""Outside **the godswood**, we must make no sound. **Pull up your hood and hide your face."" Sansa nodded, and did as he said.** (ibid)

We're explicitly still in the godswood here, and what happens? Sansa at last raises her Sandor-ish hood and thus *covers her maiden cloak-esque pearls,* symbolically subsuming a symbol of her maiden cloak with a symbolic Sandor's-bride's cloak.

Moments later, Dontos throws up from drinking too much wine and reveals he has for once dressed as a knight. I can't think of any other drunks with a fraught relationship with knighthood, can you?

##Sansa's Sandor Chastity Belt
It's pretty plain that Sansa and Sandor are symbolically married in the godswood, *not* when Sansa merely huddles in the Kingsguard cloak Sandor discarded.

So in-world, where does Sansa get this symbolic Sandor wedding cloak she wears?

Before I address the *amazingly cool* literal answer to that question, notice that Sansa is given something quite similar immediately after she balls up and tries to burn the evidence of her menstrual blood, thus performing an inadvertent (figurative?) bloodmagic ritual to protect her from Joffrey and ""summon"" a protector:
&gt;In the end it took three of them to pull her away. And it was all for nothing. The bedclothes were burnt, but by the time they carried her off her thighs were bloody again. It was as if her own body had betrayed her to Joffrey, unfurling a banner of Lannister crimson for all the world to see.

&gt;When the fire was out, they carried off the singed featherbed, fanned away the worst of the smoke, and brought up a tub. Women came and went, muttering and looking at her strangely. They filled the tub with scalding hot water, bathed her and washed her hair and gave her a cloth to wear between her legs. By then Sansa was calm again, and ashamed for her folly. **The smoke had ruined most of her clothing. One of the women went away and came back with *a green wool shift* that was almost her size. ""It's not as pretty as your own things, but it will serve,"" she announced when she'd pulled it down over Sansa's head.** ""Your shoes weren't burned, so at least you won't need to go barefoot to the queen."" (COK S IV)

Her ""green wool shift"" isn't a cloak, to be sure, but it's a fascinating object of inquiry, as I'll explain.

GRRM is a nerd and knows his medieval fabrics and clothing. The term ""shift"" as it was classically used prior to the 19th century meant a sort of loose undergarment. It was basically the original underwear, before underwear was sexy.

Shift began to be replaced by the term ""chemise"" when shift started to have indecent connotations. Chemise and shift became essentially interchangeable, centuries before either was stylish or sexy or the ""shift dress"" became a Thing. Wikipedia and some online dictionaries even redirect searches for shift as clothing to ""chemise"".

But what else is a chemise?
&gt;In medieval castles the chemise (French: ""shirt"") was typically a low wall encircling the keep, protecting the base of the tower. (wikipedia)

Now, the whole point of the ""cloak ceremony"" is to take the bride from ""her father's protection to her husband's"", right? (SOS Ty VIII) And here Sansa is given a Sandor-colored-and-fabric-ed green wool ""shift"" AKA ""chemise"" AKA ""low wall encircling the keep, protecting the base of the tower.""

This, in a world in which ""come-into-my-castle"" is a thing, in which its inherent winking allusion to sex has been lately… well… *winked* at by Tyrion and Penny:
&gt;""When you were a little girl, did you ever play come-into-my-castle?""

&gt;""No. Can you teach me?"" (DWD Ty IX)

(Also a Thing mentioned in the same breath, by the way? ""Hide-the-treasure"", a la Theon and his oak bole.) Symbolically, then, Sansa basically just got a figurative, comfortable chastity belt in Sandor's color and fabric. She is symbolically protected by Sandor, just as a woman is symbolically protected by her husband after their wedding ceremony. Figuratively, then, the shift could be said to be doing the job a wedding cloak might do. More precisely, perhaps, it symbolically safeguards her chastity from the threat it faces from her marriage to Tyrion and preserves it until she can enact her simultaneously figurative-but-true marriage to Sandor *and perhaps ultimately consummate it.*

The shift's link with Sandor may be ironically emphasized by the woman who gives it to her:
&gt;""It's not as pretty as [Sansa's] own things, but **it will serve.**""

As ugly dogs faithfully do.

Pretty nifty stuff. But I still haven't told you where Sansa gets the symbolic bride's cloak in Sandor's color she puts on in the godswood.

##A Dye Job
Thanks to /u/aowshadow, who directed me to [this post about Sandor's bloody Kingsguard cloak](https://ladygwynhyfvar.wordpress.com/2013/11/16/the-bloody-cloak/), I actually think it's pretty clear that the cloak Sansa puts on in the godswood is in fact *Sandor's bloody Kingsguard cloak,* which Sansa has now *dyed dark green* in order to obscure its blood stains. (If this somehow isn't the literal, in-world truth, it's *absolutely* the figurative truth, given all of what follows.)

Consider first that we're told early in ASOS that she has *kept* Sandor's cloak:
&gt;**She had his stained white cloak hidden in a cedar chest** beneath her summer silks. She could not say why she'd kept it. (SOS San I)

The cloak then disappears, but after Alayne flees King's Landing with nothing but the clothes on her back—viz. her deep, dark green cloak and brown wool dress—she thinks of it in a way that's at least consistent with her still owning it:
&gt;[Sandor] took a song and a kiss, and **left me nothing but a bloody cloak.** (FFC Ala II)

Sandor's abandoned Kingsguard cloak is specifically (a) bloody and (b) *wool*, right?
&gt;She found his cloak on the floor, twisted up tight, **the white wool stained by blood and fire**.

Now, recall that in AGOT, Arya ruins Sansa's ""ivory silk dress"" (i.e. a white dress that sounds like a real-world wedding dress) with the ""red"" juices of a *blood* orange—
&gt;""Liar,"" Arya said. Her hand clenched the **blood orange** so hard that **red juice oozed** between her fingers.

&gt;""Go ahead, call me all the names you want,"" Sansa said airily. ""You won't dare when I'm married to Joffrey. You'll have to bow to me and call me Your Grace."" She shrieked as Arya flung the orange across the table. It caught her in the middle of the forehead with a wet squish and plopped down into her lap. 

&gt;""You have juice on your face, Your Grace,"" Arya said.

&gt;It was running down her nose and stinging her eyes. Sansa wiped it away with a napkin. **When she saw what the fruit in her lap had done to her beautiful ivory silk dress, she shrieked again.** (GOT S III)

—causing Sansa to ""ball up"" the dress and throw it into her fireplace—
&gt;The blood orange had left a blotchy red stain on the silk. ""I hate her!"" she screamed. **She balled up the dress and flung it into the cold hearth, on top of the ashes of last night's fire.** (ibid.)

—*exactly* as she does with her bloody bedsheets (which so clearly evoke the ""bloody sheet"" from a maiden's wedding night)—
&gt;She pulled the torn sheet from the bed, and the stained blanket as well. I'll have to burn them. **She balled up the evidence, stuffed it in the fireplace,** drenched it in oil from her bedside lamp, and lit it afire. (COK S IV)

—and very much as she does her Stark-ish maiden's clothing in the godswood—
&gt;**She balled [her gown] up and shoved it into the bole of an oak, shook out the clothing she had hidden there.**

—when it is metaphorically transformed by the tree into the brown wool dress and ""*deep* green"" cloak, which she chose specifically because Dontos said to *""dress dark""*.

Now, what does Sansa do with her white real-world-wedding-style dress stained ""red"" with ""blood"" (orange) *after* she shoves it into the ""ashes of last night's fire""—""ashes"" immediately reminding us of Sandor's ""soot-grey garments and of Sandor's shadow being called *""dark as ash""*? (GOT B III) *She dyes it a darker color to hide the ""blood"" stains!*
&gt;Her gown was the ivory silk that the queen had given her, the one Arya had ruined, but **she’d had them dye it black and you couldn’t see the stain at all.** (GOT S V)

Dye is foregrounded throughout ASOIAF. We read of dyers and dye over and again. (The first time is when Dany sees a cloth trader buying some *green* dye. [GOT Dae VI])

Bloodstains that have been partially cleaned out of white wool are often brown-ish with, as ladygwynhyfvar's essay points out, a greenish hue. Recall that the cloak Sandor wore to tourney was ""olive-green"". Sansa having Sandor's Kingsguard cloak dyed a deep, dark, perhaps olive shade of green to hide the bloodstains perfectly pays off the throwaway detail of her dying her stained ""wedding"" dress, and transforms a cloak that was wholly unsuitable to be a figurative bride's cloak symbolizing Sandor Clegane into the apt metaphor we see in the Kingswood.

A final symbolic connection seals it. Remember how the green roughspun clothing Sandor wears when he reverses his colors to disguise himself is called ""splotchy""?
&gt;…the Hound himself was garbed in **splotchy green roughspun**

Guess when else green things are explicitly ""splotchy"" in ASOIAF? When they're the hands *of a dyer's apprentice,* as seen *under an oak tree!*
&gt;They found Lommy where they'd left him, **under the oak.** ""I yield,"" he called out at once when he saw them. He'd flung away his own spear and raised his hands, **splotchy green with old dye.** (COK A V)

GRRM, everyone!

Sandor is a huge man. Only Gregor is bigger. He's Sansa's benchmark for size:
&gt;The Lord of Runestone stood as tall as the Hound. (FFC Al I)

Thus his cloak would have been *way* too big for Sansa, but (a) it's foregrounded that it could be torn when Sandor tears it off and discards it—
&gt;**Sansa heard cloth ripping** followed by the softer sound of retreating footsteps. (COK S VII)

—and (b) as ladygwynhyfvar notes, Sansa spends half of ASOS sewing—
&gt;[Margaery's] cousins took Sansa into their company as if they had known her all their lives. **They spent long afternoons doing needlework** and talking over lemon cakes and honeyed wine… (SOS S II)

—so she certainly could have made herself a suitably-sized cloak out of the fabric.

What ladygwynhyfvar misses is that there's a very good chance Sansa's ""thick brown wool"" dress with the pearls on the bodice was crafted using fabric from Sandor's huge, bloodstained cloak as well, dyed *brown* to hide the blood and decorated with pearls taken from her maiden's cloak. Sandor's cloak could easily provide sufficient fabric for a Sansa-sized cloak *and dress,* and it just so happens that Sansa's ability to sew a dress is foregrounded *when Arya portentously ruins Sansa's white dress with the ""red"" ""blood"" of an orange:*
&gt;""Washing won't do any good,"" Sansa said. ""Not if you scrubbed all day and all night. The silk is ruined.""

&gt;""Then I'll … make you a new one,"" Arya said.

&gt;Sansa threw back her head in disdain. **""You? You couldn't sew a dress fit to clean the pigsties.""** (GOT S III)

It makes sense that Sandor's abandoned cloak might be notably thick wool. After all we've see Meryn Trant, Jaime Lannister and Arys Oakheart all wear ""heavy wool"" Kingsguard cloaks, and when Sandor throws his cloak around Sansa the first time, after the riot—
&gt;The coarse weave was scratchy against her skin, but no velvet had ever felt so fine. (COK S III)

—it sounds thicker than thinner (and not at all like silk). (GOT San IV; SOS Jai VIII; FFC tSK)

Thus when Sansa dons her figurative bride's cloak and a dress that causes her to more completely mirror Sandor's green-and-brown color scheme, the garments are likely *both* made out of Sandor's cloak, bringing the overarching wedding metaphor all the more sharply into focus.

With Fire and Blood out, it's safe to say that we've gotten most of the information we'll ever get from Martin on the Dance of the Dragons. It's a war that's been given a lot of attention--not least because it'll be referenced in Winds of Winter when Dany hears of Aegon--and has a lot of in-universe impact as being the near-end of the time of dragons. The consensus on the conflict by the fandom, however, has been that it's something Martin wrote to make readers hate both sides. If the Blackfyres were meant to have a romantic tragedy element to some of them, then the Greens and Blacks are to be seen as terrible people who burnt the Realm, killed thousands, and caused the temporary extinction of a species for their own sakes.

But there's a problem with this depiction.

In fact, I'll go so far as to argue that the Dance of Dragons is one of Martin's weakest elements in the entire ASOIAF series. Not because neither side is likeable, I would argue Martin wrote the war hoping we would identify more with individuals than 'sides', but because his own message is undermined by how he's written them. It's the same with the Blackwoods and Brackens; he wants us to think it's a tragedy that neither side can put down their weapons, but he ends up writing one side as better than the other.

In the Dance of Dragons, both Greens and Blacks burnt Westeros, but at least the Blacks could dance.

Allow me to detail my case. 

**The Steps**

The conflict is meant to be more than just an argument of whether the eldest child, even if they're a girl, or the eldest son inherits and that even if Rhaenyra is legitimate, her very actions disqualify her. Both she and Aegon are meant to be equally ill-suited for the throne.

But at the very beginning, Martin depicts one as evil but determined and the other as just plain awful. When Viserys I dies, Rhaenyra is on Dragonstone giving birth in what many characters call ""the woman's battlefield."" Aegon? Whether it's getting a blowjob from a 12 year old or some other carnal act, it's telling that the most favourable account has him protest only to be easily cowed by his mother. In reality, we can assume he grasped for that chair like there was no tomorrow.

And what of precedent? The Greens' first action is not to cite the precedent of the Great Council and that it may override the whims of a single King. There is no attempt at establishing an genuine narrative for the group outside of Criston Cole's oh-so-wonderful summation that women don't get to rule, and that gays are disgusting. Viserys' body is hidden away to rot while the Master of Coin is murdered by the Lord Commander. Tyland Lannister goes crude-Machiavelli in claiming that oaths after twenty or so years don't really count any more. It's only later that they create an actual narrative.

For modern readers, already inclined to support the principle of the Blacks in that the eldest child should inherit regardless of gender, Martin doesn't do much to convince us that the Greens aren't just the villains of the piece. If Martin wanted to depict the Blacks as descending to the level of the Greens, I could buy it, but there's little to suggest that this was his intention.

The Blacks, however, start out as underdogs and take bold steps to make alliances. Throughout most of the pre-Blood and Cheese era, the Blacks take heroic-coded actions while the Greens act like the villains. It's a dynamic that colours a lot of the battles of the war as well. As noted by u/Vikingkingq aka Race For The Iron Throne, the Greens often win only by treachery, luck, or the intervention of foreign allies. IIRC, Daeron is among the only senior Green to secure a straight victory on his own while Aemond mostly sticks to using his dragon--Vhaegar, the biggest and deadliest of the dragons--to terrorise villages and get his uncle's attention.

It's rather like how the Blackwoods are blood of the First Men, keep to the Old Gods, marry Starks and have other 'good-guy' coded traits while the Brackens are often portrayed as being on the 'wrong side'. They betray the Blackwoods to support the Ironborn Hoares and often can be found with the lesser Targaryen Kings, starting with Aegon II and going up to even Aegon IV. Martin wants us to see both sides are wrong, but fails to actually follow through on example of equal flaws.

So we have the Greens already appearing like not only the villains, but this points to another problem they face...

**The Dancers**

The Blacks and Greens both have terrible people inside their groups. They commit evils and have evils committed against them. I doubt anyone can look at Rhaenyra and disagree with the conclusion that she would be a female Maegor, nor that Aegon II would have been Robert if Robert lacked his people-skills.

But let's not pretend one side doesn't have the clear advantage when it comes to people of ability and personality.

Think of the Greens; who among them isn't only competent, but has some semblance of a moral-compass? Queen Helaena and her children, Tyland, Daeron Targaryen, and Hobart Hightower are all I have. Larys Strong and Otto Hightower are certainly the silent pillars, but the former is an expy for Littlefinger who spends much of the conflict hiding in the city (years after likely killing his family) and the latter arguably did much to start the civil war in the first place. These are not the foundations of a sympathetic side and Martin means for it that way.

But he wants us to think the same of the Blacks and, well, that's just not happening. The Blacks have the Starks, Manderleys, Tullys, Arryns, and Blackwoods on their side. In short, they have 'the Good Houses' fighting for them. Not only that, but they have Mushroom the Dwarf and the Dragonseeds of which all the bad-sees go over to the Greens eventually. The Blacks appear more representative of Westeros than the Hightower-Westerland clique the Greens end up stuck with.

Of the lords themselves, they have Cregan Stark, Kermit and Elmo Tully, and Benjicott Blackwood and his aunt Aly. And that's ignoring who the Blacks have from within the Crownlands. They have Corlys ""the Sea-Snake"" Velaryon, they have Rhaenys the Queen That Never Was, Rhaenyra's ""Strong Boys"" are all bold and courageous, Daemon's daughters Rhaena and Baella are both admirable women and the latter is an expy of Arya. As for Daemon himself, for all his evil he is never denied as an effective commander and skilled player.

As for the Greens, they start with a full-house and still manage to nearly lose it all on the first hand. Their best dragon-rider is Aemond, who picks fights with and loses to children. Otto Hightower is humiliated by his grandson and is seen by future generations like Maester Pylos as a failure of a Hand. Unwin Peake goes on to plot the murder of children and has a pathetic fall from power.

The less said about Criston 'Got Cucked' Cole, King-Maker and Fedora-Wearer, the better.

To return to the Bracken and Blackwood comparison, it's telling how the Brackens get associated with the likes of Aegon IV, the Blackfyres, and the Greens, while the Blackwoods side with who Martin writes as the good-guys. If Martin is trying to tell a tale of both Greens and Blacks being awful, he could have done better to resolve the disparity in talent and charisma.

But the dissonance between intention and implementation is largest in one particular regard.

**The Climaxes**

One of the lines in ADWD that defines the book, and the series as a whole, is in one of Quentyn's chapters. ""Men's lives have meaning, not their deaths."" Death may colour a perception, but it is how they lived that counts.

But Martin doesn't display that here.

The 'good Greens' get the following deaths; Helaena and her children are murdered or commit suicide in awful ways (and that's assuming Halaena wasn't put through the punishment-by-rape Mushroom claims she suffered), and Daeron is either ambushed or a literal case of ""Rocks fall, everyone dies"". Hobart Hightower gets to die stopping Ulf the White from causing any further suffering, and Tyland Lannister dies dignified in bed, but that's two exceptions in a long and embarrassing line of defeats in battle or executions. The Great Houses that side with the Greens are rewarded by being reduced to being ruled by children and female Regents, and if that's not a repudiation of the Greens' entire casus belli then I don't know what is.

Contrast that with the Blacks. The Strong Boys die tragically, but it's more than just an act of nihilistic spite. Jace dies turning back the Triarchy fleet, Luke perishes against the mightiest dragon, and Joffrey tries to save his dragon. Rhaenys--a woman of fifty-five--almost turns an ambush against her attackers; crippling Aegon II and likely would have slain Aemond and Vhaegar if it was them alone. Again, this was an old woman on a smaller dragon, taken by surprise. Addam Velaryon all but saves King's Landing and destroys any viable independent Green power-base with his last stand, all in the name of redeeming him and his fellow loyal Dragonseeds. Even Celtigar has his son valiantly stand against the mob until stabbed in the back.

One side dies pathetically and the other dies nobly, tragically, honourably. Martin must have known how it would appear.

But the biggest case lies in Daemon Targaryen's death and the death of Aemond and Criston Cole. The former lived his life like an evil Sam Vimes; a filibustering crime-lord who ordered Blood and Cheese. Surely, if Martin wanted to show neither side deserving support, it would be through him. But, instead, he gets something like a love-story (no account offered, not even Mushroom's, challenges this) with Nettles. He stoically goes to his death, challenges Aemond, and dies leaping from his dragon as if he's from a heavy metal album. Aemond, on the other hand, dies because his uncle plays him like a chump and he can't take off his seat-belt in time.

After all Daemon did, he gets to go out like a hero, while Criston Cole is shot by arrows like a normal soldier and told flat-out that he caused the war. I'm not saying Cole didn't play a strong part, but it's telling that one of the more disgusting of the Blacks gets something like true love and to go out a legend, while the best a prominent Green can hope for is to survive the war with all their parts attached.

Even at the end, when both of them are meant to be equally awful and seen as ill-deserving of power, Rhaenyra gets to spit words of defiance before a dragon eats her, while Aegon lingers on in burnt agony, his dragon dead, and making orders out of spite with his cause lost.

Just as the Brackens are often undone by their flirtations with the likes of Harwyn Hoare, the Greens, Aegon IV, and the Blackfyres, they again suffer in ASOIAF. Lord Bracken tries to exploit the loss of a war and the practical subjugation of the Riverlands just to spite the Blackwoods. It's telling that part of Jaime's attempt at redemption is to invert this and instead punish Bracken more, and that he gets the closest thing to a balanced version of the conflict from Hoster Blackwood.

But Martin undermines the messages he tries to invoke with the Brackens and Blackwoods, if on a smaller scale, that he attempts with the Greens and Blacks. It even feels as if the conflict only lasts as long as it does because the dragons must die if they are to be reborn. It's admirable that he didn't want to simply cut-and-paste ""this side is good because they want a Queen."" But rather than create a narrative that challenges the idea of anyone being a rightful ruler on blood alone, Martin simply creates a narrative where we have no faction to support morally, only for all the individuals we wish to get a happy ending to all be on the same side.

In the Dance of Dragons, all of Westeros burnt, but it's hard to escape the image of the Blacks dancing gracefully while the Greens stumble drunkenly about. And, as crude as it may sound, there is a difference when asked who we might prefer.

TLDR; Both are sides terrible, but only one just plain sucks.

So, apologies for the length of this, but here’s my existential dilemma, do I think it is even reasonable for GRRM to conjure up even a quarter of all the mind blowing material the fandom has dreamed up since ADWD was released? Was it ever possible? Have I been standing on this cliff for too long?  With all the smart, creative people poring over his work and digesting his characters for years, wont some of our plot ideas and reveals inevitably be more satisfying than the ones we are actually going to get? GRRM is but one man, and we are thousands.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  None of this is me worrying about GRRM as a writer.  I know the book(s) will be great and have full confidence in his talents.  This is about me worrying as a patient fan that due to the unprecedented popularity of the show and books, and the fact that its been 7-8 years since the last release, armies of clever fans have come up with enough possible endings for this series that 30 GRRM's in 30 parallel universes could publish 30 different endings and be proud of them all.

One thing I found interesting is how I have to space out my reading. I need to only read when I want to. For example, I just started ACOK a few months ago. I was finding it a drag (I had read the last 400 pages of AGOT on airplanes just the week earlier) and was way too burnt out to enjoy the book so I put it down midway through Sansa's first chapter because I was bored to tears. However, after getting excited about the series again, I decided to try the book again and found that very chapter to be enthralling.

0,1,0,49,21,"This assumes that R+L=J (which it does. It does.) and that Aegon is a Blackfyre (a neat theory, but not anywhere close to fact). 

Regarding Ned and Illyrio, it's interesting how they are put in a similar situation. Both have essentially a scion of a fallen noble House, the heir apparent of a dynasty that claimed the Iron Throne. Jon is the head of House Targaryen, Aegon the head of House Blackfyre. Both their claims are tenuous at best, having lost a giant civil war, but especially for Jon but also a bit for Aegon, there are people who would want to seat them on the Iron Throne.

So... what do they do? Ned raises Jon as his own, likely never telling anyone of Jon's real heritage to keep him safe. Ned would never dream of pressing Jon's claim to the Throne, partially because Robert is his friend, but also because doing so could very well spell death for Jon. Doing so means relegating Jon to a bastard status, which we see does bother him a lot even if he learns early on that he still had it better than 95% of Westeros. Would Jon have wanted so desperately to leave Winterfell if he knew the truth? Is his life as a brother of the Night's Watch really what Lyanna would have wanted for her son? We can see the compromises and sacrifices Ned made regarding Jon, and I wonder if he died thinking he kept his promise, or if he had any regrets. 

Meanwhile, Varys and Illyrio plot and plot to seat Aegon on the Iron Throne. Aegon is given a High Lord's education, like Jon, but it is specifically to prepare him to be a King. Right now, it looks like they might succeed. Aegon has landed with the Golden Co., he may in fact marry Arianne and get the spears of Dorne behind him, the Faith may choose him over Tommen, and Randyll Tarly might defect to his side with his large army. We may very well see Aegon triumphantly sit on the Iron Throne by the end of *TWOW*, surrounded by cheering crowds. But as Cersei once said, *when you play the game of thrones, you win or you die*. Ready or not, Aegon's a player now.

When dropped from a fair height, these jars would explode, and the force of the explosion would cause the shards to break and fly in all directions which could help take out multiple enemies (including WW) at once.

0,1,0,32,5,"In this episode with the always excellent LmL, HoW discusses the idea that the Daynes and Hightowers may have descended from a common ancestor to the Valyrians from the GEotD. It’s an excellent episode on an excellent show but one thing has been bugging me about it. 

Their supposition is based largely on Dany’s vision in the House of the Undying where we get a glimpse of the former emperors. They all have hair the colour of precious metal and eyes the colour of gems. The Targs and Daynes for example have silver or platinum hair and amethyst eyes. 

They speculate that they arrived in Westeros’ south east coast and established their houses. Both of which have buildings or relics that are WAAAY beyond what the first-men were supposedly capable of (the base of the Hightower and Dawn) 

All good so far. My problem is this. Why were the Lannisters not included in this speculation? They have hair of beaten gold and eyes of emerald and live in a castle unlike anything else in Westeros. 

They mention the Seastone Chair and Pyke, both supposedly built before the arrival of the First Men, yet don’t consider the house with hair of precious metal and gemstone eyes that lies directly between Oldtown and the Iron Islands. It is also said to have been inhabited before the arrival of the First Men.

“Tarly.” When he tried to speak, the blood dribbled from the Old Bear’s mouth down into his beard. “Tarly, go. Go.” “Where, my lord?” His voice was flat and lifeless. I am not afraid. It was a queer feeling. “There’s no place to go.” “The Wall. Make for the Wall. Now.” “Now,” squawked the raven. “Now. Now.” The bird walked up the old man’s arm to his chest, and plucked a hair from his beard. “You must. Must tell them.” “Tell them what, my lord?” Sam asked politely. “All. The Fist. The wildlings. Dragonglass. This. All.” His breathing was very shallow now, his voice a whisper. “Tell my son. Jorah. Tell him, take the black. My wish. Dying wish.” “Wish?” The raven cocked its head, beady black eyes shining. “Corn?” the bird asked. “No corn,” said Mormont feebly. “Tell Jorah. Forgive him. My son. Please. Go.” - chapter 33, Samwell


Few things to note:

1. As Jeor died, blood spilled into his beard

2. The Raven repeated ""now"" three times, in relation to Jeor telling Sam to make for the wall

3. The Raven plucked a hair from Jeors beard

4. Five times, the Raven spoke. Three were ""now"", the last two times were questions: ""wish?"" And ""corn?""

The Raven insists that Sam leave for the wall, and plucks a bloody beard hair from Jeor. Then asks Sam for a wish, and then for corn. For a bird that seems to choose it's words, why *WISH*? Why did the Raven take a bloody hair from Jeor's beard?

I know this is probably trivial, but for the life of me I can't shake the feeling there is something hidden here.

0,1,0,8,103,"At first I thought the Doom of Valyria was just a reference to Atlantis and Numenor, but H.P. Lovecraft also wrote a short story about a great civilization that suddenly fell called [the Doom that Came to Sarnath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doom_that_Came_to_Sarnath). A lot of Easter Eggs are in TWOIAF as well.

Not only it is called ""the Doom"", people of Sarnath were also originally shepherds, just like Valyrians.

&gt;After many aeons men came to the land of Mnar; dark **shepherd folk with their fleecy flocks**, who built Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron on the winding river Ai. And certain tribes, more hardy than the rest, pushed on to the border of the lake and built Sarnath at a spot where precious metals were found in the earth. 

They quickly became imperialists and subdued their neighbors with conquest.

&gt;**So Sarnath waxed mighty and learned and beautiful, and sent forth conquering armies to subdue the neighbouring cities**; and in time there sate upon a throne in Sarnath the kings of all the land of Mnar and of many lands adjacent.

They became apex of civilization and built great towers, walls and other architectures like Valyria. Also note that description of chariot passing over walls in used for walls of Volantis.

&gt;**The wonder of the world and the pride of all mankind was Sarnath the magnificent**. Of polished desert-quarried marble were its walls, in height 300 cubits and in breadth 75, **so that chariots might pass each other as men drave them along the top**. (...)

&gt;But more marvellous still were the palaces and the temples, and the gardens made by Zokkar the olden king. There were many palaces, the least of which were mightier than any in Thraa or Ilarnek or Kadatheron. **So high were they that one within might sometimes fancy himself beneath only the sky**; yet when lighted with torches dipt in the oil of Dothur their walls shewed vast paintings of kings and armies, of a splendour at once inspiring and stupefying to the beholder. (...)

&gt;**Lofty and amazing were the seventeen tower-like temples of Sarnath, fashioned of a bright multi-coloured stone not known elsewhere**. A full thousand cubits high stood the greatest among them, wherein the high-priests dwelt with a magnificence scarce less than that of the kings.(...)

&gt;Wonderful likewise were the gardens made by Zokkar the olden king. In the centre of Sarnath they lay, covering a great space and encircled by a high wall. And they were surmounted by a mighty dome of glass, through which shone the sun and moon and stars and planets when it was clear, and from which were hung fulgent images of the sun and moon and stars and planets when it was not clear. 


Some people realized that something was going wrong and fled the city.

&gt;And it was the high-priest Gnai-Kah who first saw the shadows that descended from the gibbous moon into the lake, and the damnable green mists that arose from the lake to meet the moon and to shroud in a sinister haze the towers and the domes of fated Sarnath. Thereafter those in the towers and without the walls beheld strange lights on the water, and saw that the grey rock Akurion, which was wont to rear high above it near the shore, was almost submerged. **And fear grew vaguely yet swiftly, so that the princes of Ilarnek and of far Rokol took down and folded their tents and pavilions and departed for the river Ai, though they scarce knew the reason for their departing.** (...)

&gt;And the princes and travellers, as they fled from the doomed city of Sarnath on horses and camels and elephants, looked again upon the mist-begetting lake and saw the grey rock Akurion was quite submerged.

Anyways, reading Barth's record of Aerea Targaryen in Fire and Blood convinced me that something Lovecraftian was going on with Valyria.

&gt;How could the gods be so blind or so uncaring as to permit such horror? Or is it possible that there are other deities in this universe, monstrous evil gods such as the priests of Red R'hllor preach against, against whose malice the kings of men and the gods of men are naught but flies? (...)

&gt;What befell her on Valyria I cannot surmise. Judgeing from condition in which she returned to us, I do not even care to contemplate it. The Valyrians were more than dragonlords. They practised blood magic and other dark arts as well, delving deep into the earth for secrets best left buried and twisting the flesh of beasts and men to fashion monstrous and unnatural chimeras. For these sins the gods in their wroth struck them down (...)

&gt;The lords of Westeros are proud men, and the septons of the Faith and the maesters of the Citadel in their own ways are prouder still, but there is much more of the nature of the world that we do not understand, and may never understand. Mayhaps that is a mercy.

Yep, sounds like Lovecraft to me.

So I think it's safe to say something similar happened with Valyria. The Valyrians, consumed by their arrogance and greed, used too much magic and dug too deep in the Fourteen Flames (like the Dwarves of Moria from LOTR). After all the mages controlling Fourteen Flames got killed due to Dragonlords backstabbing each other, they woke up some unspeakable eldritch horror and brought doom upon them.

# The Heart of Winter

## The horrifying end of Aerea Targaryen



&gt;“All the maester’s arts were powerless against her **fever**, if indeed we can call such a horror by such a commonplace name.” -Fire &amp; Blood



But we know that even if it’s a fever it’s not contagious. At least not at this stage.



&gt;“the poor child was **cooking from within**. Her flesh grew darker and darker and then began to crack, until her skin resembled nothing so much, Seven save me, as pork cracklings.” -Fire &amp; Blood


So, kinda like someone being transformed through fire. And I say transformed because she is not dead yet.


&gt;“I thought that was the most hideous thing that I should ever see, but I was quickly disabused of the notion, for a worse horror was awaiting me. That came when Benifer and I lowered the poor child into a tub and **covered her with ice**. The shock of that immersion **stopped her heart at once**,” -Fire &amp; Blood


So now she’s dead, but only because of ice… wait what?



And then a lot of little monsters( Firewyrms) come out of the body. And of course they’re firewyrms because their description matches the description of the firewyrms almost word by word.



&gt;“I do not know how to speak of them…they were…worms with faces…snakes with hands…twisting, slimy, unspeakable things that seemed to writhe and pulse and squirm as they came bursting from her flesh.” -Fire &amp; Blood



&gt;”Some were no bigger than my little finger, but one at least was as long as my arm” -Fire &amp; Blood


&gt;""Firewyrms. Some say they are akin to dragons, for wyrms breathe fire too. Instead of soaring through the sky, they bore through stone and soil. If the old tales can be believed, there were wyrms amongst the Fourteen Flames even before the dragons came. The young ones are no larger than that skinny arm of yours, but they can grow to monstrous size and have no love for men."" AFFC - Arya II 


Okay, but now it gets more interesting:


&gt;“Whatever they might have been, they were  **creatures of heat and fire**, and **they did not love the ice, oh no**. One after another they thrashed and writhed and died before my eyes,” -Fire &amp; Blood


These words next to each other cannot be random. Creatures of heat and fire who did not love ice! Okay, we’re getting somewhere.


&gt;“From the very start we have asked, Where did Aerea take Balerion? We should have been asking, **Where did Balerion take Aerea?**” -Fire &amp; Blood


So why would Balerion go back to a wasteland? We know that Balerion is possibly the only living thing that remembers Valryia. We also know that a skinchanger slowly dissolves into their second skin and after sometime the “skin” takes back control. So Balerion has been riderless and we could assume that he remembers things, knows things. Maybe a threat or an unfinished business before he is completely useless and cannot even fly around a city.


And after return:

&gt;“jagged rent down his left side almost **nine feet long**, a gaping red wound from which his blood still dripped, hot and smoking.” -Fire &amp; Blood

The emphasis is on the length of the wound. This means that the wound was not inflicted by a human or a human blade.


&gt;“It was subsequent to this that Barth began the researches and investigations that would ultimately lead him to write Dragons, Wyrms, and Wyverns: Their Unnatural History, a volume that the Citadel would condemn as “provocative but unsound” and that Baelor the Blessed would order expunged and destroyed.” -Fire &amp; Blood


So there were more information delivered by Barth but the absolute dumbest and worst person in the entire story is responsible for their disappearance. Is there a deeper reason why he ordered this? Probably not, he’s an extremist nutcase. But from the title of the book we can assume that the link between the dragons and firewyrms were drawn by Barth because of the incident that happened to Aerea. And from this we can assume that there were experiments being done on living things.


What happened to Aerea was not a one time incident and is what got out of hands and destroyed Vlyria.


All of this is considering that the story is certainly a post-apocalyptic story where knowledge, history, and advancements have been lost. Not only because of the doom of Valyria but because Vlyrians are told to have been sheepherders before becoming genetic modifying dragon-riders. It’s mentioned that the Vlyrians learned their arts from more mysterious people. Not only that but it is said that there has been dragon bones in Westeros from a time before there were humans there ( Which is irrelevant because there could have been people and dragons before it was emptied).

&amp;nbsp;

## A wall of ice



&gt;“Silverwing “does not like this Wall.” Though it was summer and the Wall was weeping, the chill of the ice could still be felt whenever the wind blew, and every gust would make the dragon hiss and snap. “Thrice I flew Silverwing high above Castle Black, and thrice I tried to take her north beyond the Wall,” Alysanne wrote to Jaehaerys, “but every time she veered back south again and refused to go. Never before has she refused to take me where I wished to go.” -Fire &amp; Blood

We’ve always had suspensions as to why Silverwing couldn’t pass the wall. Now considering what we’ve read above we might know exactly why. Let’s add that this visit takes place during the summer and it’s the only time a dragon has gone that far to the north. And if it was winter time no dragon could reach even that far. So just like how a tub of ice stopped Aerea’s heart and monsters, a bigger tub of ice could stop Silverwing’s heart and she is not willing to let that happen.

Now let’s visit an older quote:

&gt;“Can a bird hate? Jon had slain the wilding Orell, but some part of the man remained within the eagle. The golden eyes looked out on him with cold malevolence.” -ASOS - Jon II


And now for the reverse. 


&gt;The sound was shocking, ear-piercing, thick with agony. Varamyr fell, writhing, and the 'cat was screaming too . . . and high, high in the eastern sky, against the wall of cloud, Jon saw the eagle burning. For a heartbeat it flamed brighter than a star, - ASOS - Jon X

Because it's not winter yet, and not cold enough. because a certain species should pass through there and bring the winter over before Orell's eagle could pass.

## What is dead may never die but rises again, harder and stronger

Disclaimer: I don’t have quotes or passages for this part and this is my personal answer to the puzzle.


Everything is burning, the people and the lands. Fire-walker creature monsters and worms are multiplying through corpses and dominating. This is the result of some failed experiment or a weapon of mass destruction possibly targeting a lot of people, or a specific group of people. It targets humans and turns them into hosts of fire creatures. Grayscale or what causes the greyscale is invented to fight against this fever but is probably not effective or enough(Not sure about this one). The last of those people run to the north of what is now known as Westeros. The Heart of Winter is created or activated to fight back. Humans are turned into the ice creatures that are now known as the Others. A wall of ice is raised to protect the north from the fire monsters. Time passes. some of the wastelands are habitable again. The Heart of Winter is set to activate every many years as a measure of safety and humans have decided to contribute to the constant creation and the maintenance of the population of the Others. Now the fire is breaking again ( either by accident or someone is behind it. I do have a thought about that too) and it’s about to spread while no one is even remotely aware of it. This will be a surprise to all characters and readers. Others are coming to stop it at any cost while humans are oblivious. And so **winter is coming**.

In this CCXP interview, Maisie gave special attention to the beginning of each arc in her S1 story (noting different points of progression) and the decisions Arya ultimately makes.

For starters…

Arya begins S8 as the fighter she always wanted to be. So what elements in her S8 story arc creates that pressure on Arya to go against who she wants to be like it did in S1? Recall her line in S7, **“The world doesn’t just let girls choose who we want to be.”**

Arya’s strong bond with Jon. Descisions from all the way back in Winterfell when she broke the rules and kept Jon’s gift to her in Needle (without her parent’s permission) and later denies her father the truth when he asks her who gave her the sword. Arya would not betray Jon, not even for her father.

S1 doesn't have her Kill List/No One/FM storyline. S8 is Arya through and through. Which tags nicely with **Maisie’s recent comment about S8: seeing a lighter more fun Arya that we knew at the beginning of the series.**

Maisie also made it very clear that she got to do everything she wanted for Arya in S8 which makes what she has said (in an interview after reading the S8 scripts) of what she wants for Arya very enlightening:

&gt;**Question**: Do you have ideas about how you’d like Arya’s journey to end?

&gt;**Maisie**: I’ve always said I wanted her to find peace. The things that have been driving her through her story have been very bitter and twisted and aggressive. I would love for Arya to find her true self again and let go of this anger and revenge that’s accompanied her on this journey. I’d love for her to be happy.

At the end of S1, Arya witnesses a family member die. In her own futile way, she tries to save them but is powerless to stop it from happening.

Arya is forcibly turned into Arry the orphan boy at the end of S1. Her hair shredded and cut off by Yoren while she cries and tries to stop him. Perhaps we may see something similar happen again? Remember she is a fighter and the warrior going into S8 but maybe that will not be her final state by the end of the season? Something pushing her to change who she wants to be. Bittersweet.

Maisie also revealed that Arya has goals in S8 that she has never had before. 🤔

&gt;The actors were forbidden in the interview to talk about the series’ eighth season, but Maisie also gave clues to Arya’s future. “Back to Winterfell was amazing, it was her focus throughout the show,” she says. **“In this new season she has completely different goals, which she has never had before,”** she says.

The incident at the Trident. Choosing to protect an innocent smallfolk boy when attacked by someone highborn and royal. That descision has major consequences, she has to let Nymeria go and Lady dies in her place.

To become Arry, accepting this new identity that was forced upon her as her way to survive and make it back home.

Also, Maisie said right at the end of her recent series recap interview, that after LF’s death scene **""they make a conscious decision to see a change in Arya.""**  👀 It seems these changes will continue into S8.",1,(Spoilers Extended) Hints &amp; Predictions for Arya's S8 plotline,3690,66

0,1,0,29,5,"It baffles me that Game of Thrones didn’t include Lady Stoneheart. It would have been an internet-breaking moment. The TV-viewing audience who haven’t read the books would have gone apeshit over it. The reveal that Catelyn Stark has been brought back from the dead seems like too good a moment to pass up. I just can’t for the life of me figure out why they didn’t do it.

At first I thought maybe she doesn’t play much a role later in the books, or the Brotherhood doesn’t (they had been pretty much absent from the show since season 3). But then the Brotherhood randomly pops back up in season 6. I also can’t imagine Cat not having much a role in the books. She’s got Brienne bringing Jaime to her. Two major characters maybe facing their deaths. Even if neither die and they end up killing her or something, that still seems like such a good moment for them not to include. Imagine Cat coming back to life and then Brienne or Jaime killing her. How could the TV-viewing audience not love that?

There’s even theories she will orchestrate a Red Wedding 2.0 and kill all the Freys at Devan Lannister’s wedding. How is that not something the show would want to include? I guess they wanted Arya to kill all the Freys. That was kind of a cool moment, but the Red Wedding 2.0 seems like a much better scene. The Red Wedding was such a huge TV moment. If George is going the way of a reverse Red Wedding where the BWB kill a bunch of Freys and Lannisters, that seems like that too would have made for a huge TV moment.

Maybe they just didn’t want to bring Michelle Fairley back only to put her in tonnes of makeup and prosthetics and give her no dialogue. Alex Graves talked about that. I really don’t get that either. An actor doesn’t need dialogue to give a compelling performance and it might even be an interesting challenge an actor would like to take on. Alex Graves described her as a “zombie” but I think that’s a poor interpretation of the character. She is Catelyn Stark, but death has changed her and she’s hellbent on vengeance. She looks like a zombie because her body was left underwater for so long. But she’s not a stereotypical mindless zombie. She’s a legit character with motives.

0,1,0,10,6,"I've heard many complain that ""the prequel will not have dragons"" because ""Dragons did not come into the main story until Valyria"".  I've always thought this to be crazy, and that dragons likely played a huge role in the story of the long night. 

However, outside of mentions of possible dragons from the great empire of the dawn and the super obvious reference to the last hero's ""dragonsteel"", I don't know if there's been any direct evidence of dragons during the age of heroes, until I saw this reading F&amp;B (p. 476). 

&gt;Legend has it that during the Age of Heroes, Serwyn of the Mirror Shield slew the dragon Urrax by crouching behind a shield so polished that the beast saw only his own reflections.  By this ruse, the hero crept close enough to drive a spear through the dragon's eye, earning the name by which we know him still. 

Am I right that this is the first direct reference to dragons in the age of heroes?  What does this mean for the story of the long night?

He was already outspoken against Mellisandre and if someone came into his office and saw poison on his desk the night of a feast, well it’s an obvious conclusion to reach. Might have been Pylos himself who revealed his mentor’s plot. 

Stannis didn’t wake Cressen for the feast, the singer knocked him over, and Selyse humiliated him in front of the bannermen. My guess is these were all efforts to save Cressen from himself. If he missed the feast, was injured in the fall, or stormed out in rage he wouldn’t do what they all knew he was going to do.

But just in case, Mellisandre took an antidote before hand, so that if Cressen persisted in his folly she would be safe.

0,1,0,10,5,After reading several northern rebuild fics based on asoiaf/GoT which all include the establishment of a port town at Sea Dragon Pointon to serve as the main western port of the north. From what maps I've seen of the north the area northeast of the stony shore and southwest of the wolfwoods would be preferable to sea dragon point as a port city as it has potentially good transport links with the ryswell and tallhart lands. Also most of the area is flat and I would assume is possibly fertile meaning that it could feed a potential city. Whereas Sea Dragon point's transport links to the bulk of the north aren't really that good as it requires whoever wants to go to the rest of the north to travel through the wolfswood. As a the major trading port on the west coast wouldn't that be detrimental. The only advantage that I can see about sea dragon point over the other area is that sea dragon point has large amounts of lumber suitable for ship building. But then that also means that the land is unlikely to be able to support a large population. From what I can tell it has been chosen by the virtue that its actually mentioned in the books by Asha Greyjoy when she has taken sea dragon point and later more than most other places on the western coast.

The singing in strange tongues... and the animals' aversion to whatever is happening. In AGoT we get a description of the horses' reaction, whereas in ADWD Martin writes about the monkeys in the boat, who start panicking and just throw themselves overboard.

Bottomline: the greatest thing about this moment is Victarion's transformation; a thick-headed, narrow minded commander who is now the embodiment of two gods, or two major cosmic forces - the drowned God and the Red God. This shift in character, and the power this gives him is tremendous... I was just wondering if anyone read anything further into it.

Additionally, never anywhere (that I can recall) is it ever mentioned a Targaryen passing down knowledge about dragons, dragon riding or dragon hatching to their children.

Especially after the Jaeherys chapters where he clearly knew the importance of dragons(the only reason his family ascended and remained in power), you would think he would catalog all information so it can be passed down through the generations.  The only thing even close we get is Seton Barth’s book that is lost to history, and he isn’t even a Targaryen.

They seemingly don’t even piece together that dragons thrive and grow larger on Dragonstone, which should be very easy to see.  One glaring example is Jaeherys own dragon Vermithor.  Vermithor was younger than Dreamfyre but actually grew bigger because his time was spent on dragonstone. 

-Did they truly just not have the knowledge?

-Do you think their knowledge and passing on dragon related info is implied but not spelled out in the text?

-Do you think that because Dragons are highly intelligent magical creatures there is no rulebook on riding and hatching and whatnot?

0,1,0,53,9,"So, when we leave off in *A Dance with Dragons*, our favorite brooding Northern ""bastard"" is in a bit of a *sticky* situation...

He's dead. But maybe not for long! As has been documented thoroughly, Jon will probably come back. My question, then, is what happens to Jon? 
We know what happens in the show: Jon dies, Stannis gets wrecked by the Boltons, Jon returns, Jon+Sansa take down the Boltons, Jon gets crowned King in the North. But will his story follow the same path in *The Winds of Winter*?

For all the speculation of how Jon comes back, for what Rickon might be up to on Skagos, for how Stannis might fare against the Boltons, for how Jon will take the revelation that R+L=J (and it does. That's a certainty) I haven't seen a compelling vision of what Jon Snow gets up to when he comes back to life.

Well, let's assume that this is an area of significant divergence between the books and the show. Let's also assume that Jon doesn't get resurrected at the very end. That is, let's assume that Jon actually *has* a story in *Winds*. So what possible paths lie ahead for the man who was once the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?

First: he stays at the Wall. This is probably my least favorite option, honestly. There's a lot of debate here over whether dying and coming back to life releases someone from the Night's Watch, or whether a King's will can do the same. Honestly, it feels a bit like debating if Ol' Bobby B's Targaryen ancestor gives him a claim to the Iron Throne. It was Robert's hammer, not his blood, that made him King, and whether you think Jon deserved it the fact remains that he was *murdered by his own men*. There's no way he does anything other than throw up two middle fingers and tell the Night's Watch to fuck itself when he comes back.

Maybe Jon goes North to save the Wildlings at Hardhome? That feels like a death sentence, and it's probably a moot point by the time he returns.

So maybe he finds Stannis? After all, Stannis is widely believed to beat the Boltons, retake Winterfell, install Rickon Stark as Lord of Winterfell, and march South to deal with the Lannisters and (maybe)Targaryens. Maybe Jon does the same? I dunno. It feels like that ship sailed when Jon became Lord Commander of the Night's Watch instead. Why retread that path? Maybe it's just me, but I feel like it would undermine Jon's arc in ADWD if Jon basically went, ""Welp, I tried this whole Lord Commander shtick out. Didn't work. Yo Stannis, is that offer still on the table?"" Jon Snow has always been a man of action, a man with goals who struggles to achieve them, and there's no story there. Is there? It looks like Jon just becomes a side character without much agency until R+L=J breaks him, which is boring, in my opinion.

So... what does Jon do? This is where that silly title comes into play. I think the reason D&amp;D wrote season 6 the way they did was because there's too many storylines at play in just the North, and they have the rest of Westeros, Braavos, and Meereen to deal with. I mean, we have:

* Stannis beating the Boltons

* Davos ""rescuing"" Rickon

* Sansa maybe bringing the knights of the Vale North

* whatever adventures Jon gets up to

It makes sense for them to try and consolidate all those into one story, even if the end result wasn't what we all wanted. But for *The Winds of Winter*? There's no place for Jon Snow in the North and I have no idea what he is going to do. 

That being said, here's some baseless speculation and nonsense tinfoil I came up with for what Jon might do when he comes back.

I think he might have a dark turn.
[This person thinks he's coming back darker than ever](https://offmichaelsbookshelf.wordpress.com/2016/02/24/return-of-the-white-wolf-jon-is-coming-back/), and they paint a pretty grim picture of what Jon might be like. 

It makes sense - Jon and Daenerys go through very similar story arcs and [Daenerys may go very dark](https://meereeneseblot.wordpress.com/2013/10/06/untangling-the-meereenese-knot-part-v-hizdahr-and-peace-or-daario-and-war/) in *The Winds of Winter*, so it logically follows that Jon post-resurrection might do the same.  

But as to what he actually *does*?, that's where I hit a wall. Maybe Jon declares himself King on the Wall, like the Night's King did in the Age of Heroes. Maybe Jon, broken and frustrated by a betrayal over what he thought was protecting the realm, decides that the Others aren't his concern anymore. *Let the Watch fall if that's what they want*, he might say. Maybe Jon goes to war with his siblings like that dream of his might have implied:

&gt;The world dissolved into a red mist. Jon stabbed and slashed and cut. He hacked down Donal Noye and gutted Deaf Dick Follard. Qhorin Halfhand stumbled to his knees, trying in vain to staunch the flow of blood from his neck. ""I am the Lord of Winterfell,"" Jon screamed. It was Robb before him now, his hair wet with melting snow. Longclaw took his head off. 

&gt; - *A Dance With Dragons*  Jon XII

But does anyone really want that?  Any of that? I know I don't. I like the idea of the Starks sticking together while the Lannisters and Baratheons kill each other. So I don't even have any idea what a dark turn for Jon Snow would look like lmao. This is why I'm not GRRM. He'll probably come up with something gripping and brilliant, but I have no idea what. 

I'm curious for your thoughts, though. What does Jon do? Does he stay at the Wall? Join Stannis? Go Dark? Something else entirely?

0,1,0,50,34,"* I think Jon's credit from the Iron Bank for buying food throughout the winter will be a very important factor in the future. He cannot and will not simply walk away from the Night’s Watch as it happened in the show. As revealed in Fire &amp; Blood, we can expect a massive starvation and lawlessness throughout the north in the rest of the story, far worse than it happened during Cregan Stark’s reign. During such times, a lot of people will talk along the lines like “The Lord Commander has food up there. He promises to feed anyone who helps him. You do not even have to take the black.” In fact, Jon said more or less this same thing to Alys Karstark. This will surely help Jon assume a much greater leadership role in the future, even a de facto King in the North, despite he will still be the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch.

* Finally, this huge debt to the Iron Bank, for which Jon is responsible, will be influential in the politics of the Realm. We can expect that the Night’s Watch will be in no shape to repay these huge debts. If the Night’s Watch is disbanded at the end, all the better drama. The Iron Bank will surely make the argument that this debt belongs to the Iron Throne (even if it is wasted after the Mad Queen plot) and the whole Realm. They will probably push for a pretender who is willing to repay all the debts of the Iron Throne (including the expenses of Robert, Cersei etc.) plus the debts of the Night’s Watch. 

* The wishful and naïve scenario that Westeros will return to divided kingdoms at the end should really die out. That is not the reality of this world. How will these divided kingdoms pay the past debts to the Iron Bank? Since they won't be able to do that even if they want, do you think the Iron Bank is incapable of sending Faceless Men after all the Lords declaring independence and refusing to repay any debts to the Iron Bank? In addition to that, the rebuilding of Westeros will need a lot of new loans, which they can't get anywhere if they refuse to pay the past debts to the Iron Bank. No. In every scenario, the Iron Bank will have a huge sway in deciding the political resolution of Westeros. And their interests lie with a united kingdom ruled by a monarch able and willing to repay all these debts.

* The end is very clear with this perspective. The surviving Lords will gather at Harrenhal in a Great Council like assembly. The Iron Bank will make them an offer they can't refuse. Don't expect anything less from people who threatened Jaehaerys the Fucking Concilliator with wiping out his House.

0,1,0,207,448,"I think Rosalin Frey was already pregnant when she married Edmure. It's kind of strange that Rosalin, the 5th daughter of Lord Walder &amp; a beautiful woman, was not among the many, many female Freys offered in marriage to a King, but later, when Edmure, merely a Lord Paramount, was coerced into marrying a Frey she was the only woman offered to him.

We know that George likes to show parallels between the past and present and the only Frey wedding from the past that he's written about was the marriage of Lord Butterwell to Lord Walder's sister in ""The Mystery Knight"". The bride had been disgraced when she was caught having sex with a servant and the wedding was a used as a means to plot treason against the Crown. Considering how slim the chances are that Edmure got Rosalin pregnant after just one night with her I think she was already pregnant so Lord Walder took a page out of his father's playbook and used the Red Wedding as a pretext to get the Northern Army to gather at the Twins so he could slaughter them and as a bonus he gets rid of his unmarried pregnant daughter and secretly humiliates Edmure by 'giving him horns'.

Nothing about that cat is normal, so I got to thinking about that cat in relation to the Varamyr POV, which was pretty much an expose on telepathic movement of a consciousness/spirit into another being, especially at death.  Rhaenys by all accounts has the right genetics for warging/dragonriding (through her Blackwood blood from Aegon V's wife and possibly from Elia through Dornish Danaerys).  I am thinking that one of the reasons that cat may be so special is that a part of Rhaenys lives on inside it, just as Orell lives on inside the eagle and CotF live on inside the Ravens.

* Elissa’s dangerous journeys and her constant fugitive life might have caused some misfortunes due to which Melony was sold to slavery and trained as a temple prostitute in Volantis. This explains 

1. her suppressed memories including “Melony, Lot seven.” 
1. her saying “I could give you pleasure such as you have never known” to Davos. 
1. “She was weeping, and her tears were flame.” and “All who serve within this mighty temple are slaves, bought as children and trained to become priests, temple prostitutes, or warriors; these wear the flames of their fiery god as tattoos upon their faces.”

* After a certain point, she perhaps had certain visions in the fire and fled to Asshai for advanced studies in magic, especially shadowbinding. Or perhaps she was sent there by the Red Temple. In Asshai, she learned magic from a shadowbinder for “years beyond count, and she paid the price”. In the process, she turned into an undead. She chose a new name for herself combining her birth name with the names of her mother and uncle:

&gt;What Blackwood urged, Bracken opposed, as ever; Lord Jonos Bracken rose to insist they ought pledge their fealty to King Renly, and move south to join their might to his.
""Renly is not the king,"" Robb said. It was the first time her son had spoken. Like his father, he knew how to listen.
__________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;""Renly is crowned,"" said Marq Piper. ""Highgarden and Storm's End support his claim, and the Dornishmen will not be laggardly.

Let's say instead of defending Stannis' claim, Robb agrees with Bracken and Piper and decides to join Renly. Robb isn't crowned. They'd probably meet at Bitterbridge, unless Renly decides to rush north and join them at the Goldroad. 

Would he have left Edmure and his riverlords behind or taken some of them with him to swear fealty as well? What about Roose Bolton's defeated host at the base of the Neck?

What would Tywin have done? March to intercept them before they cross the Blackwater? Attack Riverrun? Move south to King's Landing? Invade the Stormlands?

Would Renly have marched on King's Landing right away, or waited for the Martells and Arryns to join him? Or would he have invaded the Westerlands from the south?

In the books, we see that as winter is approaching, everyone is treating food with increased care, and special measures are being taken to conserve as much food as possible. The most blatant example is Jon Snow's dilemma in offering the wildlings food and shelter at the wall, while at the same time hearing the brothers complain about having more mouths to feed (among other concerns). Jon wishes for glass houses like Winterfell, so that more crops could have been grown, despite the winter.

At the same time we see Theon observing the broken glass houses at Winterfell, with the produce rotting black, and food going waste. We also get to see the disapproval Ramsay gets on throwing a feast in Barrow Hall.

Firstly, we are *not* banning T-shirt posts. Please feel free to post pictures of your cool and interesting LOTR shirts - this includes unique designs you've done yourself. Posters may also do limited self promotion of their shirts by linking to an Etsy page (or similar safe/trusted vendor).

So, here's what the bots are doing. One bot (often 7-8 month old accounts with little karma) will post a question ""where did you buy it?"" but note that the question is often in poor/broken or awkward English. This is the setup for the second bot to reply with a linked comment to an online shop. The second bot will disguise their link - so it appears to be one domain, but is actually another. They use a stock website template with stolen images of the t-shirt from the thread. If you buy from these sites you **will** be defrauded by likely having your credit card information stolen and you'll never get the t-shirt either!

What we are going to ban is bots who are posting in T-shirt threads. We are looking for your help with 2 things:

1. Please report any links to t-shirt shops - these links pop up and you know they're dodgy. 
2. Please also report the top level comment (usually in poor English) asking where you got the shirt.

**Note that sometimes the comments asking 'where you bought it?' will have lots of upvotes. This is being done by bots too, to try and get their links visible. So don't be fooled by upvotes!**

If you're not sure about reporting an account, check its post history. There will be little to no activity. That's a giant red flag.

If you wish, please also comment that the post is a bot, to warn other users not to follow the links. 

Upvote friendly comments warning of bots, downvote any post you know to be a bot that is advertising tshirts. This will help hide those posts until mods can get rid of them.

Once a comment has 3 reports it's removed by auto moderator. We are then more likely to see it and ban the bots - as well as add the domains to the banned list. 

Finally, if you post a t-shirt please try and watermark it or put lines across the design. Do something to make it difficult for bots to steal and repost onto their own websites. This also protects your intellectual property if you're trying to create and sell your own original work.

Thanks for your support everyone. We'll get rid of the bots, we just have to be vigilant.

I've been watching a lot Lotr since I'm 10 years old, but as a french little boy, I firstly watched it in french. Although french voices are really amazing, compared to other movies, I was wondering if it was worth it to watch it in english. It can sound obvious for some people, but watching it 30 times in the same language really makes the, in this case, french voices stuck in your head when you see/read a lotr content (even if it is in english).

So I was wondering if other fans went through this language change and how it did impact the movies for you ?   
And maybe, are their some people here watching Lotr in another language ? Which one ?

I somewhat recently got The One Ring but have yet to play a game. I'm new to tabletop RPGs like this so I don't know where to begin. I've been watching Roll20 to see if any good newbie games come up but haven't got into one I could do yet.

My question is, where is a good place to start with The One Ring and similar RPGs? Is there a YouTube tutorial that you would recommend, maybe a good game recording for demonstration, etc etc. I imagine questions like this are asked a lot but anyone has a good starting point, or another thread that answers these questions, that would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

We recently got the Shadow of Mordor games with Shadow of War being released last year.  Although I think it's a neat direction with them including characters from the Silmarillion like Celebrimbor, I would have liked to see them stick closer to the canon laid out by Tolkien and how he represented those characters.  

&amp;#x200B;

I would personally like either an RTS in the style of BFME or a semi-realistic adventure/action game that focuses on a different aspect of the war of the ring.  Shadow of Mordor was fun but I think it would be cool to play as a Dunedain ranger without superpowers or as a dwarf in Erebor during the battle of Dale (think of a first person Warhammer: Vermintide style of gameplay).  

&amp;#x200B;

I think we can all agree that the hobbit was not a long story and having three dedicated films to be consistent with the LOTR Trilogy was completely uncalled for. To encompass the entire book 2 movies would have been enough, possibly more. 

But objectively as films they are pretty awesome, and hating on them is negativity the Tolkien community doesnt need.

The Hobbit Trilogy is much like Ready Player One in the sense that both film franchises take major deviations from the books and manage to... not suck. Big fans of both the Hobbit and Ready Player One the books (which I am), want the movies to fit into this neat little box of the Book-to-Film adaptation stereotype... that they suck, when in reality they’re just like every other above average film: they work in some places and falter in others. 

For a while those same people wanted the LOTR trilogy to suck too, mainly citing the whole, « Where is Tom Bombadil? » and « Elves were never at Helm’s Deep » arguments, but lets be honest the LOTR community would never be as large as it is now if it weren’t for those movies. Were the original LOTR films inaccurate? Very much so. Did they suck? No. The same rules apply to The Hobbit.

EDIT: the redditor ChristopherJRTolkien has very correctly pointed out that people don't like the movies for far more reasons than its deviations from the source material. At the very least, deviation from the source material is one of the reasons why I wasn't satisfied by the Hobbit Films.

Personally, I knew nothing about it when I first watched the movies. Never even heard the word Hobbit or Orc before. 
I absolutely loved these movies, I was glued in from the very beginning and was extremely fascinated with the whole fantasy world. I loved the characters and my emotions were definitely present, especially after it was all over. I loved that world so much it kind of made me depressed for a while,or maybe I was already depressed and that just added to it, I don't know.

Anyways, it is because of the Hobbit that I decided to watch LoTR, and I did not regret it. Even to me LoTR is much, much better than the Hobbit trilogy.
Why are the Hobbit movies hated on? I've never really heard an argument other than people saying they stretched it out too much or something like that. 
The way I see it, that's a good thing. I mean that whole adventure if it actually happened would have taken much longer than the timespan of a 2 to 3 hour movie. Wouldn't you want to experience the real thing?


The question on Aragorn, something I never really understood through my several watchings of the series. What exactly does it mean when they say the line was remade, and how?

I have always held out watching the LOTR franchise movies and have run away from the spoilers since I have wanted to read it at some point in my life. I am proud to say that I managed to do that just yet. I completed reading The Hobbit and the Fellowship books and am now at the crossroads on if I should watch the First movie before I go on to read The Two Towers or if I should hold out and  complete all the books before watching the movie.

The book was amazing and I was able to picture middle earth the way I want to and have funny images of all the characters in my head. But maybe, just maybe watching the movie will make the text sink in further and I might be able to follow through the later books with more insight?

I would appreciate comments and suggestions! ",0,New entrant to this amazing universe,787,36

AFAIK, Sauron hadn’t used Smaug in all that time (even when he was getting his butt kicked in the War against the Elves in SA 1693). 
Was the Quest of Erebor a mission set up by Gandalf just so Bilbo (resistant to the power of the ring) could find the One Ring and get it out of Gollum’s cave so it could be destroyed, or was that just a lucky happenstance, in a mission that was originally only to kill Smaug so Sauron couldn’t use him in his war on Middle Earth?

He can read and write elvish without issue but speaking it correctly still takes time for him (he is super into it though!)
Once he read the inscroptions, I was disappointed to find that the inscription repeats the first two lines on the outer surface twice and the second half is on the inside, along with the other info (maker, material, etc.)
I still like the ring, it is really nice. I still am disappointed that such a schematic was put out as if they thought no one thought to check. Hope this isn't the same with the other ones...

P.S. I know that the engravings belong on the inside as described in the book. Also, the ring had plenty of room to fit the four lines of elvish script onto the outer surface.

TL;DR: bought the licensed replica ring and was disappointed at engraving accuracy.

First time LOTR reader and loving it! Just read the Treebeard chapter in ""The Two Towers"" and it's definitely one of my favorite parts of the whole series so far. I'm particularly haunted by the story of the Ents and the lost Entwives.

My big question is-- if Yavanna breathed life into the first Ents, HOW and WHY was there such a major difference in living lifestyles and preferences between the Ents and Entwives that ultimately split them up? With the Ents representing more typical ""male"" roles thriving in wilderness and the Wives representing ""female"" roles thriving in peace and orderly gardens, how did Yavanna NOT see this is a huge problem? The two seems horribly incompatible...how would Ents and Wives ever be expected to share their lives together?

Thoughts? Am I thinking too deeply into this? Or missing something? Or just plain wrong? Thank you!",0,How did Yavanna create such incompatible differences between the Ents and the Entwives?,872,87

What do they entail what the respective Silmarillion chapters do not? I've read something about further details from the Unfinished Tales but I'm not sure.
Speaking of which, are the Unfinished Tales worth reading as well? Because these contain a version of Children of Húrin as well (if I'm not mistaken, which I very well might be).

I guess what I'm really asking is whether each and every book is really unique on its own in that it has details that others do not.  Your input?

I am actually having a little difficulty wording this in a way that makes sense. The 9 for men I assume were identical as well as the 7 to the Dwarfs, it's just a case of where there 2 types of rings between them or 16 identical ones?

It was very powerful when Galadriel talked about how no matter the outcome of Frodo’s quest that Lothlorien would come to an end. If Frodo failed, the armies would eventually attack and burn down the forest. Or Frodo is successful and the ring of power is destroyed and Galadriel’s ring loses its power and she leaves to the west, and Lothlorien’s magic inevitably fades with the fading of the elf magic.

In that discussion I heard that the director intended The Hobbit to be watchable in either ratio (16:9 / 21:9), therefore I'd really like to figure out if there is a specific blu-ray release which holds the 16:9 version in it.

The intensity of Arwen's face when she calls the river to flood. Gandalf's Black Speech of Mordor, the depth of the love between Arwen and Aragorn, the beginnings of the Fellowship (""Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?"") and opening music out of Rivendell. Saruman talks to ravens like Bran, the cautious movement into Moria, the cave troll, the desperation on the Stairs, and the absolute terror of the Balrog as it marches after the Fellowship.

Crazy Galadreal, fighting Uruk-hai, too much lembas bread, she gave me three, and the incredible aerial shots of the boats. That shot of the log with the Uruk-hai running and that excellent cross-fade with the boats again. The jealousy of Boromir, the opening of Aragorn's defense, and the hobbits rescue by Boromir. The horn that blows over and over again. The desperation of the rock-throwing and the Lurtz's entrance to those vocals.

2. Are people aware of who Gollum is? I mean every day people not Gandalf or some other higher being.   I'm asking because scenes where Gollum and someone other than Sam and Frodo are involved it seems that everyone generally just hates him. Yea I get that Faramir knew there was an evil thing at the top of the pass and that Gollum had trespassed into a sacred pool but I don't think that's justification to hate him.

Tom is, within his own domains, essentially omnipotent. The ring has no power over him. He's self driven and self directed. He hangs out with Goldberry. Life is good if you're Tom Bombadil. But wait...

Elrond literally says he ""forgot"" about Tom Bombadil. Tom Bombadil, who has been around literally since creation. As far as has been explained, he was the first  being on Middle Earth. He was around for all five of the great wars, likely familiar with the Ainur and the Valar, and yet...his global impact is ZERO. he doesn't take a stance against darkness. He doesn't take a stance at all, actually. He just IS. 

The only beneficial thing Tom Bombadil does in Middle-Earth history is release the hobbits from the tree and from the Barrow Wights. I'll concede that the Barrow Wights thing was kind of a big deal, but Tolkien could have had someone else get them out. 

Is the whole point of Tom a lesson in the Taoist Principle of the ""usefulness of uselessness?"" Is Tom a big middle finger to readers who try to ascribe some deeper meaning to his character? What in the world was Tolkien trying to say?

Any and all thoughts are appreciated!

Along with Aragorn, he demonstrates a very seldom seen calm demeanor when confronted with the corrupting power of the Ring.  


I feel like his decision often gets swept by the wayside, but along with Aragorn, he is the only human that seems to have the quality of character to have allowed Frodo to continue on into Mordor, instead of taking the ring and using it for his own. It is very likely that there are a very small number of men in Middle-Earth would have made this decision at such a time of crisis, having learned a lesson from history and Isildur's tale.  


His heroics are immeasurable when compared to his family and blood, with Boromir and Denethor both showing a lustful desire for the ring, Faramir remains true.  He easily could have made the decision Boromir did and would have doomed Middle-Earth but his ""desire to appear lordly and generous as a king of old, gracious, gentle"" literally winds up saving everyone.

(My last hate post on the movies did so well I figured I'd come back for more.)

The book, particularly Fellowship, is a road trip story (fight me), but Tolkien goes beyond your usual road trip book like Travels with Charley and gives you all of the visceral sensation of moving from place to place, setting out the views, the distances, the difficulties, and the sensations of travel. (That's even a large part of The Hobbit.)

That's why maps feel so helpful or vital to the book. Geography matters in LOTR in a way it doesn't in a lot of other fantasy.

Jackson could have conveyed a sense of where things were in relation to one another. Instead, the movies were a beautiful set of images of places, one after another, with no sense given of how they connect to one another, even when the geography is part of the story-telling. And that lessens the sense of how the characters have to travel, have to make hard decisions, and how they are split up from one another.",0,Peter Jackson and geography in LOTR,1194,35

Here’s the structure for the films. There are also minor edits within this structure for specific shots or lines.

Film 1 - An Unexpected Journey:

No prologue (The dwarves basically explain the backstory to Bilbo in Bag End so there’s no need for 2 prologues, and it’s also more like the book)

Act 1: Bag End through the Trolls scene.

Act 2: Rivendell through the Mirkwood barrel escape. (Gollum is the midpoint)

Act 3: Dwarves meeting Bard through the dwarves opening the secret door to Erebor.

Film 2 - There and Back Again:

Act 1: Smaug stuff, ending with his death.

Act 2: The tense buildup to the battle.

Act 3: The battle of the five armies + resolution obviously.

(I included some extended edition scenes that are necessary like Thorin’s funeral.)

This includes that crazy ice river goat chariot scene mainly because it’s members of the 13 dwarves instead of just random CGI dwarf #253.

I also made it as close to the book as I reasonably could, it’s not perfect because of the way the original films are constructed.

The only major plot holes I ended up with are that the dwarves magically get ponies after leaving goblin town because I skipped over Beorn, and Kili magically gets healed from his injury because I cut out Tauriel.

(Also, I know Beorn is in the book but he doesn’t really add much to the story and he just slows it down.)

I made the story more focused on Bilbo so I excluded the dwarves part of the goblin town sequence, and I made the ending anti-climactic like the book where Bilbo gets knocked out and misses the end of the battle. (And the audience does too.)

Hi ! I have been thinking about war prisoners in Middle Earth recently. Orcs are cowardly creatures, they will flee and their morale will break if they are not driven by a great hatred, lead by an intimidating commander, or if they are sure of their victory. So in a battle which is turning bad for them, wouldn't there be plenty of orcs, those than can't flee, who surrender ? Begging for their lives, asking for mercy ? Am I missing something from the books where it's stated that Orcs don't do that ? 
I can imagine that all of the free Peoples wouldn't take mercy for Orcs (especially among Dwarves and Elves). But the question of pity is important in Tolkien's world, it's one of Bilbo and Frodo's greatest qualities, and in the end it their pities that saves the quest for the Ring, for if Gollum had not lived, things would have played put differently at Mt Doom. The question of knowing if Orcs are purely evil and entirely unredeemable has been discussed many, many times by Tolkien fans. But I don't know if it fits the morale themes of the story to have the heroes slaughter surrendering ennemies, Orcs of not. They spared Saruman, and Aragorn and Gandalf even ask for Sauron to surrender before the battle of the Black Gate begins !
So are they prisons where Orcs are kept, like in Minas Tirith maybe ? That also seems a bit odd. What happened to eventual Orcs that surrendered after the Battle of Pelennor ? 
Let me know what you think.

(I'm asking the question for Orcs specifically since I assume it would be very different for Men. In the aftermath of the War of the Rings it's stated that various tribes of Men that fought for the Shadow (Dunland, Harad, etc) were forgiven. To me it seems obvious that if they were to surrender they would be imprisonnated, or even liberated, rather than put to death (at least that's what some of the Free Peoples would do, maybe not all).

0,1,0,10,7,"Alright, I should establish a few things:

1. I am very new to this subreddit. Lurked a couple of days, this is my first post.
2. I have NOT READ The Silmarillion. I have read the original LOTR books and the Hobbit, and watched their six accompanying movies.

Okay, now to my actual question: for what I know about Shelob, she seems to dwell and thrive in darkness, her pass so evil and so marred in tragedy that the few who know it feel pain uttering it's very name. That said, Shelob is no friend of Sauron. They aren't allies, and for all intents and purposes the only reason why she doesn't fight his army herself is because... she can't. And she doesn't really care about the rest of Middle Earth anyway, so why would she bother? But if that were really true then why did she try so desperately to kill Sam and Frodo, the point that she (presumably) died because Samwise stabbed out one of her eyes and cut her right down the belly with Sting? Why would it be worth it?

This general inconsistency is making me curious about the actual role of the spiders and Shelob's general interest and allegiance in the mired war and politics of Middle Earth.",0,"Where in the Factions of Middle Earth Does Shelob ""Fit?""",1152,56

0,1,0,21,11,"I just rewatched the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and fell in love with it all over again. What an incredible achievement by Peter Jackson, and everyone involved. Everything surrounding the film was so well thought out, and executed to perfection. There was only one scene that I found disappointing...the fight between Eowyn and the Witch King.

It's just lazy, and the fact that everything else in the film is done to such perfection, only makes the shortcomings of this scene that much more glaring. The Witch King up to that point is built up to be this unstoppable force, that no one knows how to defeat. He's huge, and menacing, and terrifying...and then it turns out he fights like a newborn baby.

I mean, what was that? Who choreographed that fight? He halfheartedly swings a ball and chain, and whiffs every time. He never really engages her in combat, everything is done from a distance. Merry cuts his leg, and he just collapses like he's never felt pain before. And then as he's on his knees, he just sits there and stares at Eowyn as she has time to not only remove her mask, but to also drop a hot line on him (""I am no man""), and then as she winds up to stick him in the face, he continues to just sit there. He doesn't even raise his hands to block the sword, or try to fight back.

This guy was second in command? The most feared warrior in Sauron's army? You've got to be kidding me. That fight should have been way more epic, and the Witch King should have had an opportunity to really live up to his reputation. Ultimately Eowyn had to win of course, but the way that fight played out really took away from the greatness of that moment, and they should have gone back to the drawing board and reshot the scene, so that it could live up to it's potential.

I know I can't be the only person that feels this way. Is there a consensus around here, and within the LOTR fandom, that this fight scene was handled poorly?",0,Is There A Consensus About The Fight Scene Between Eowyn And The Witch King?,1933,76

Is Elvish physical anatomy similar to man/humans or are there any key differences outside of just how they look (facially) and their noticeable different ears? From their movie/video game depictions, we only see their face and while they do indeed look different (have more pure/pristine/beautiful faces than humans), they look somewhat similar to humans in terms of limbs, bones and skeletal structure. They all appear to have 5 fingers on each of their hands similar to humans, there is really no noticeable differences outside of what I mentioned above so what i'm wondering is, did Tolkien ever discuss about how they look physically in terms of skeletal structure? Or is it implied that they look similar to humans underneath their armor/clothes?

But I absolutely hated the dwarves in the movies. Sometimes I see people online hating on Elves for being snobbish and whatnot, and frequently thinking of the Dwarves as the heroes.

But to me, there was seriously nothing likable about them. They’re stubborn, violent, arrogant, selfish, greedy, racist, and through the series rude and insulting to anyone who isn’t a dwarf (except Gandalf).

I mean, for example just look at how they behaved at each city. At Rivendell, Elrond treated them with such respect and like guests, but they instead offered the Elves repeated insults and were making an absolute mess of their house.

I could list everything they did that was so unpleasant but the list would take hours to write.

Examples of staying loyal:   
\- The Rohirrim following Thèoden King even though they might not make it out of the battle  
\- Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli sprinting over 20 leagues to save Merry and Pippin  
\- Sam doubting whether he made right call in the end and doubling back to save Frodo

Examples of not staying loyal:

I loved seeing scenes like the departure from Galadriel's wood explored in more depth, and more information on the hobbits in the beginning. Not to mention more time spent on traveling, which made the journey feel that much more expansive.

I suppose there is one other thing that sticks out in my mind that I feel I should say. When I was younger, I didn't do much looking beneath the surface of things. I thought Gandalf was the coolest because he was powerful, and I only ever thought of Boromir as a near-traitor. But now, as an adult, I can see that strength is not just measured by one's power. True, there is weakness in the hearts of men- but there is also much good and honor to be found.

I think from here on out I'll remember Boromir not by how the ring tempted him, but by how he must have been on most of the journey. Smiling, and tussling with the halflings. A warrior, a hero... and a friend to them all.

However, one thing that stands out to me is how excessively detailed it is. We seem to learn every miniscule detail of the Fellowship's journey and I can't help but find that annoying. 

Like I said in the title, I began the Hobbit a year back and only now did I start Two Towers. That's a lot of time taken to read just two books. The stories are fascinating, but (especially in The Fellowship) there are chapters which just showcase Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin just walking from one destination to another. 

So my question is, is the entirety of the series like this? It's not that I'll stop reading it, I just feel like I'll be finishing it over extensive periods of time and that'll remove all details of everything I've read from my memory.

So I understand Frodo spoke with Aragorn (at least in the movie) to tell him he wished the burden of the ring on no one else and would continue alone. So my question is... why the hell would Aragorn be ok with splitting up the group and shrug it off especially after Boromir's death?

My dad read the books to me when I was a young child, and subsequently encouraged me to read them myself just before I turned 7. He then took me to see Fellowship of the Ring when it came out at the movies and needless to say it's been one of my biggest loves ever since, for sentimental reasons linked to the love my dad has for it and also just the epic story it is. Dad also gifted me The Silmarillion when I was around 8, but at the time I found it hard to immerse myself in as much as I had with the other two mentioned.

When I found this sub though, I was (and still am!) constantly amazed at the amount of knowledge some of you guys have.

He got possessed by Saruman but when Gandalf freed him, he only acts entitled. He leaves Aragorn to die on the way to Helm's deep and doesn't have any other plan to fight back, only to retreat and hide.

He doesn't ask for help from the elves, riders of Rohirrim, and Gondor and acts ""meh thx whateva"" when Haldir joins in. In fact, he doesn't help out in the next film unless requested. Aragorn is the one who gets in to the battlefield and actually fights. Yet, Theoden asks Aragorn to save his ass at the side entrance (battering ram) and retreats after one spear poke with only ""save yourselves"". Gives up the battle saying is hopeless etc loudly in front of his men. Oh, not to mention, jinxing Saruman's forces ""is this the best you can conjure"" right before the bomb at the outer wall.

0,1,0,5,3,"Disclaimer: Nothing of this is fact. Most nations, locations or geographic features have several inspirations and interpretations.

If you look at a map of Middle Earth next to a map of Europe and the Middle East+North Africa, their similarities are evident.

- Mordor is essentially Anatolia/Turkey/Ottomans with land instead of sea around it. 

- Nùmenor was the Roman empire. Angmar (germanic tribes) broke Arnor (Western Roman Empire) apart, now the land is a ""backwater"" and fractured area. Gondor is Byzantium (ERE) holding the Balkans against Mordor (The Turks/Ottomans)

- Rhun/Khand are mongols/turkic tribes driving Germanic peoples (Rohirrim) west across the Anduin (various major European rivers). 

- The Rohirrim are essentially the Goths/Germanic mercenaries, who instead of fighting the ERE/Gondor ally with them and get large landholdings in return for military service against Easterlings (various steppe peoples from Central Asia/Black Sea).

- Dale represents Russian states (possibly Kiev) 

- Haradrim are all Middle Eastern/African peoples mixed into one. Elephants, turbans, darker skin etc. The Umbarim are Berbers/North African raiders. 

- Mordor is the major ottoman/turkic power beating in on the Byzantine defences. Minas Tirith is Vienna. Remember, Tolkien was a staunch Catholic, and an assault on Vienna, a bastion of Christian Europe by ""evil"" Ottoman/muslim forces... 
The Rohirrim are the reinforcing army that break the flank of the besiegers of Minas Tirith, like the coalition with the famous Winged Hussars and other knights who broke the Ottomans in 1592. 

- Osgiliath (west) is Constantinople, constanlty under siege by the ""evil"" forces and a shell of it's former splendour as the capital of Gondor (the ERE) who held both sides of the Anduin, only to be pushed back by Mordor (Turks) for many years, losing all holdings in Anatolia (eastern bank of the Anduin)

Overall, the westwards migration of Turkic tribes/mongols and Islamic expansion seem to be the historical inspiration for Sauron and the War of the Rings and preluding wars. I do not want a political debate over West v. East or Christendom/Islam here, only discussing LoTR lore :).

I appreciate any additions or counterarguments to what I have written here. These are simply my thoughs, and as any LoTR fan would notice, a lot is left out (hobbits, elves, dwarfs, Isengard, wizards) as I can't place it historically or Tolkien used other inspirations than (european) history for it.

If you are going to watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy for the first time, you have not yet watched the books, my advice for you is to watch the theatrical editions, as the extended edition is just sooo long and not best for someone with no prior knowledge of it, it's just a good way to start into watching the trilogy.

After I watched the theatrical editions and loved them, watching the Extended Editions afterwards and getting a second helping was, so worth it, like having a second birthday. Watching the theatrical editions after having seen the extended's just feels weird to me. I would absolutely recommend watching Theatrical first THEN Extended.

Overall I still prefer the Extended Editions for the simple reason that they added a lot scenes that I simply found entertaining  or important to the story despite having some minor issues with them. I COMPLETELY understand why people would prefer the theatrical editions, due to things like structure and pacing and buildup.

If you are going to watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy for the first time, you have not yet watched the books, my advice for you is.....

WATCH THE THEATRICAL EDITIONS!

The theatrical editions are perfect for a casual first time movie-going experience, they are best for introducing you to middle earth, if you are someone with no prior experience, a long experience like the Extended Editions may not be ideal. I do recommend watching the Extended Edition's afterwards.

After I watched the theatrical editions and loved them, watching the Extended Editions afterwards and getting a second helping was, oh so worth it, like having a second birthday. Watching the theatrical editions after having seen the extended's just feels weird to me.

The Theatrical Editions are on Netflix as of recently which is a great way to start especially if you don't use DVDs. I don't believe the extended cuts really belong on Netflix. Overall I still prefer the Extended Editions for the simple reason that they added a lot scenes that I simply found entertaining despite having some minor issues with them. I COMPLETELY understand why people would prefer the theatrical editions, due to things like structure and pacing and buildup.
